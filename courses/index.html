            <p class="post-description">Reviews and Recommendations for Computer Science and Math Courses at CMU</p>
          </header>

          <article>
            <p>Here I share my thoughts on the courses that I took at Carnegie Mellon
University. Note that my experiences with some of these courses can be highly
dependent on the professors, or due to the impact of virtual classes during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Do also check out the <a href="/cmu-online/">CMU Online page</a> for a curation of courses whose lectures
and course content are publicly available.</p>

<p>Course background: I graduated with a <a href="http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/undergraduatecomputerscience/#bscurriculumtextcontainer" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">B.S in Computer Science</a> (2018-2022) with two concentrations: 
<a href="http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/scsconcentrations/#algorithmsandcomplexitytext" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Algorithms and Complexity</a> and <a href="http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/scsconcentrations/#computersystemstextcontainer" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Computer Systems</a>,
and a minor in <a href="http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/melloncollegeofscience/departmentofmathematicalsciences/#minorstext" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mathematical Sciences</a>. 
I then did a <a href="https://csd.cmu.edu/academics/masters/ms-in-computer-science" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">M.S in Computer Science</a> (2022-2023),
with a mostly ML, theory, and stats-heavy courseload.</p>

<p>Courses with a â­ are those that I found transformative,
and those with a â¤ï¸ are those that I enjoyed a lot.</p>

<p>I donât write much about the more popular introductory or required
courses, since thereâs already a lot of word about it on the street and there
isnât much for me to add which already hasnât been said.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask any questions about the courses at CMU, including those that I
have not taken, in the comments section below.</p>

<p>Inspiration for this page came from <a href="https://wanshenl.me/courses/reviews/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wan Shenâs CMU course review page</a>.</p>

<p>For ease of navigation, Iâve also categorized the classes that Iâve taken into
the areas that they fall under, so you can just access the ones that
you might be interested in directly.</p>

<ul class="first-course-item" id="course10716">
  <li>
    <p>â­ 10-716 Â  <strong><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/716/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Machine Learning: Theory and Methods</a></strong>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Pradeep Ravikumar</a></p>

    <p>This was my favorite class this semester. It felt like a natural
continuation of <a href="#course10708">10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models</a>,
with a strong focus on understanding the theory of how many non-parametric
modern machine learning techniques work. It is very much a math and theory
course and can get pretty dense at times, but it is also very rewarding.</p>

    <p>Since there does not appear to be much information online about the specific
content covered, Iâll try to summarize them here.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Statistical decision theory: this was mostly a quick recap,
since it was covered in the pre-requisite class 36-705. 
If you did not take 36-705, itâll be helpful to learn/review
Bayesian estimators, and Bayesian and minimax risk as itâll
be used throughout the course.</li>
      <li>Nonparametric Bayesian methods: the Dirichlet process for CDF estimation,
Dirichlet process mixture for density estimation, 
and the Gaussian process for estimating a regression function</li>
      <li>Nonparametric Density Estimation: histograms, kernel density estimators,
series estimators. A key result is how the kernel estimator is minimax-optimal
over many classes of loss functions and function spaces.</li>
      <li>Nonparametric Regression: partition estimators, spline estimators,
basis/dictionary series estimators, k-NN regression,
smoothing kernel regression estimators, Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)/Mercer kernel regression estimators, wavelets</li>
      <li>Nonparametric Classification: contrasting
classification error between parametric vs nonparametric models, 
minimax rates of convergence for classification vs regression
for different function classes of distributions</li>
      <li>Nonparametric Greedy &amp; Boosting: Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm,
Greedy Coordinate Descent (i.e boosting), Adaboost,
functional gradient descent</li>
      <li>Optimal Transport: Monge assignments and the Kantorovich relaxation to
motivate Wasserstein distance, the Kantorovich dual, integral probability
metrics, applications to statistical estimation and Wasserstein GAN</li>
      <li>Deep Density Estimation: variational auto-encoders, normalizing flows, autoregressive flows, destructive distribution learning</li>
      <li>Deep Representation Learning and Kernels: RKHS kernel regression, RKHS in
relation to representation learning, random features, randomly wired DNNs and
its relation to Gaussian Processes</li>
      <li>Dimensionality Reduction &amp; Manifolds: PCA, multi-dimensional scaling
(MDS), kernel PCA, local linear embeddings (LLE), Laplacian eigenmaps,
diffusion maps, Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma and random projections</li>
      <li>Clustering: k-means as vector quantization, mixture models and local non-identifiability,
level set clustering, hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering</li>
      <li>Learning &amp; Games: online learning, Follow the Leader (FTL), Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL), 
regret bounds for FTRL on convex and non-convex action domains and loss functions, two-player games and Nash equilibrium</li>
      <li>Causality: adjusting for confounding, causal graphs and structural equations</li>
      <li>Random Forests and Kernels: Bagging, layered nearest neighbor (LNN), kernel-based view of random forests</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Pradeep is a great lecturer and he takes great effort to answer every studentâs questions in detail. 
However, while I often find myself being able to follow the current micro-level derivations and explanations,
I often feel somewhat lost about how it fits in with the bigger picture and its relation with other techniques,
possibly due to a lack of prior exposure to many of these topics.</p>

    <p>There is significant variance in the difficulty of homework problems in a
single homework, which I thought made the scoring of the homework problems
somewhat nonsensical as the points were more or less evenly distributed.  I
recall there were a couple of problems that demanded a fair bit of thought and
insight but had relatively short solutions, and therefore only netted a
moderate amount of points compared to the effort required.</p>

    <p>I thought the exams were relatively easy. It is proof-based and will ask you
to perform derivations of results or techniques related to what is seen in class,
which sounds much scarier than it actually is because the questions are relatively guided.</p>

    <p>One thing that happened this semester (and also apparently for prior semesters
according to some people that I spoke to) was the steep drop in attendance as the semester
went on.  During the first lecture, there were barely enough seats for everyone
and some people had to stand, but by the mid-way point the average attendance was
just around 5 people. However, when it came to the midterms, the classroom filled up again
and I even heard the instructor for the previous class remark how she didnât
realize we had so many students in this class as she was leaving.</p>

    <p>This was probably not such a bad thing for the people who did come to lectures, since
it meant more personalized attention from the instructor, more opportunities
to ask your own questions, and a better view of the board.</p>

    <p>I initially thought this phenomenon was because the other students (who were
mostly MLD Ph.Ds and MSML/MSDS students) were already very knowledgeable and didnât see the need to
come to lecture, but only learned much later that it was actually because many
of them also found the material challenging and found it difficult to follow the lecture.</p>

    <p>I think the takeaway here is that this will be a very difficult class (in my opinion likely
the hardest class offered in MLD), so try to go in with friends and donât shy away
from asking questions since it is likely that many people may also be confused.</p>

    <p>I really liked this class and felt that there wasnât enough information about
this course online by people who have taken it, so I wrote a dedicated
post for it: <a href="/blog/2023/advanced-operating-systems-course-review/">CMU 15-712 Advanced Operating Systems and Distributed Systems Course Review</a></p>

    <p class="course-item" id="course36709">â¤ï¸ 36-709 Â  <strong>Advanced Statistical Theory I</strong>, <a href="https://mateyneykov.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Matey Neykov</a></p>

    <p>This course largely follows <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/highdimensional-statistics/8A91ECEEC38F46DAB53E9FF8757C7A4E" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">High-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint</a> by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wainwright</a>,
with the last portion branching off towards topics in the professorâs own research interests.
This is a core course in theoretical statistics that all stats Ph.D students
must take, and most students in the course came from this demographic. The
focus of the course is on high-dimensional statistical models, and
non-parametric statistical models.</p>

    <p>There were 4 homeworks, with around 2-3 weeks between each one. They are all proof-based questions, with many
of them coming from Wainwrightâs book. I found the homeworks quite challenging, and had to collaborate with
a few stats Ph.D students to get through some of them (thank you for
introducing me to the stats Ph.D. lounge!). There were some tools required
for solving some of the problems that I have never seen or had to use before
in any of my previous CS or math classes, but which may (?) be standard fare in
statistical literature, that may have contributed to my difficulty.
Fortunately, I still managed to solve <em>almost</em> all the homework problems.</p>

    <p>Each student also had to scribe a lecture, which is then posted on Canvas as
reference for all other students. There is also a project on deeply understanding a
recent advanced theoretical paper in statistics or machine learning, which involves
both a paper writeup and a presentation of its contents to the class.
Thankfully there are no exams.</p>

    <p>Topics covered included concentration inequalities (sub-Gaussian,
sub-exponential random variables), maximal inequalities, bounded differences,
covering and packing, Gaussian and Rademacher complexity, chaining and
Dudleyâs entropy integral bound, comparison inequalities (Slepian and
Sudakov-Fernique) and lower bounds, high-dimensional and sparse PCA,
Davis-Kahan theorem, LASSO in relation to prediction/support recovery/debiasing, 
covariance matrix estimation, non-parametric least squares, minimax lower
bounds (Le Camâs method and Fanoâs method), Gaussian sequence model minimax rates.</p>

    <p>Overall I really enjoyed this class as it introduced me to many concepts in
modern statistical analysis, which is really helpful in understanding
statistical machine learning papers.</p>

    <p class="course-item" id="course36708">36-708 Â  <strong><a href="https://36708.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The ABCDE of Statistical Methods in Machine Learning</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aaditya Ramdas</a></p>

    <p>I initially did not notice this course, as I thought ABCDE meant just the basics.
However, what the course is actually about is a journey through various
methods in statistical machine learning, viewed from the following lens:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>A</strong>lgorithm design principles,</li>
      <li>
<strong>B</strong>ias-variance trade-off,</li>
      <li>
<strong>C</strong>omputational and memory considerations, <strong>C</strong>alibration, <strong>C</strong>onformal prediction,</li>
      <li>
<strong>D</strong>ata analysis,</li>
      <li>
<strong>E</strong>xplainability and interpretability.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Aaditya is really clear, and he will re-iterate the important
points many times throughout the class, sometimes too many times in my opinion,
which was fine but it would also be good to learn more content instead.  I
also heard from some other students that he is one of the best lecturers in
the stats department.</p>

    <p>Most of the class is on non-parametric methods, covering
techniques like nearest neighbor methods, distribution-free predictive inference,
calibration, decision trees, bagging, random forests, stacking, boosting,
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), kernel methods like kernel
ridge regression and kernel PCA, Shapley values, spectral PCA,
and some basic deep learning topics like deep PCA.</p>

    <p>I found the class very practical and helpful, and learned a lot as someone
with no data science and practical machine learning background. This was
especially from the many discussions on which techniques were suitable for
which contexts, according to the ABCDE methodology.</p>

    <p>A lot of the topics in this course were familiar to other students who came
from a traditional stats background, and I feel like you might get bored in
this class if you already have a pretty solid stats foundation. Otherwise, 
there is a lot youâll learn.</p>

    <p>The midterms and homework were both relatively chill. Homework included both
theoretical derivations, and also experiments on datasets using methods
learned in class.</p>

  <li>
    <p class="course-item" id="course36708">21-329 Â  <strong>Set Theory</strong>, Benjamin Siskind</p>

    <p>I initially got interested in this class as quite a couple of theorems from my
other classes appealed to important results from set theory, such as Zornâs
Lemma used for proving Tychonoffâs theorem. Since set theory is such a foundational
topic in mathematics, I wanted to take it to satisfy my curiosity.</p>

    <p>This course covered all the chapters in <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/course-on-set-theory/9E65D5D9CA561CA2D87F91B21B0D117D" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A Course on Set Theory</a>
apart from 6, i.e ZFC, order, cardinality, trees, and filters and ideals.
It starts fairly slowly, and speeds up towards the latter of the second
half. I could see some parallels between set theory and type theory
initially in the more constructive concepts, but they soon began to differ
greatly due to the heavy use of non-constructive methods
in the proofs of set theory.</p>

    <p>The most interesting topic for me was the development of trees and Baire
spaces, which led to the study of games and determinacy,
with the consequence that sets which are determined have certain nice
properties.</p>

    <p>The course was taught by Benny, a postdoctoral associate teaching the class
for the first time, so it was expected that there would be a few rough edges.
Benny cares about the class, is passionate about the course content (he
does research in model theory and descriptive set theory), and responds to
emails and clarifications fairly promptly.</p>

    <p>I think the course could have been paced faster at the start. It was also
challenging to read the lecturerâs handwriting sometimes. I felt there was
significant time pressure for the exams (similar to <a href="#course21301">21-301
Combinatorics</a>), though the homeworks were quite reasonable.</p>

    <p class="course-item" id="course17604">17-604 Â  <strong>Communications for Software Leaders II</strong>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frollini/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dominick (Nick) Frollini</a></p>

    <p>The highlight of this follow-up class to 
<a href="#course17603">17-603 Communication for Software Leaders I</a> are the mock
negotiation in-class exercises that we had to prepare and role-play for.
Prior to each mock negotiation, we were provided with case
materials developed by the
<a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kellogg</a> MBA program that contains
important private information specific to our role, which must
be kept secret.
We then planned out our negotiation strategy before class, possibly with
other people in the same faction so as to present a unified front
against the other parties during negotiation.</p>

    <p>The mock negotiations were really exciting as they put us in the shoes
of roles as diverse as CEOs, government officials, hardware designers,
or even fishermen. You will have specific instructions on
the kind of personality traits, negotiation style, and cultural
customs that your role will have. I really indulged myself in this,
especially since I took <a href="#course70350">70-350 Acting for Business</a>
not too long ago. The outcome of the negotiations will directly
affect your grades, so these are really high-stakes, high-pressure
situations that you will be put into. It was extremely fun and
entertaining.</p>

    <p>Nick is a very passionate teacher with clear and well-paced lectures.
Itâs obvious he has done this so many times that itâs almost
like a rehearsed performance. In my opinion, if you are already
planning to take <a href="#course17603">17-603</a>, then you must take
this course as well since the mock negotiations were so much fun.</p>

<p>Units: 60</p>

<p>This was the final semester (out of 2) of my Masterâs degree. My
goal for pursuing a M.S degree is to reach the frontiers of a field
and find a research interest, which I did in theoretical machine learning.
I mostly leave without regrets, except for one: not having been able to
work with any of the brilliant professors here on research, since I found
my direction so late.</p>

<p>I TAâd for <a href="https://andrejristeski.github.io/10708-S23/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">10-708 Probabilistic Graphical
Models</a> under <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Andrej
Risteski</a> this semester.
It was a fun experience and not as stressful as I had feared. Being
able to lead 2 of the recitations was one of the highlights of my semester.
I would like to thank <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Andrej</a> and my
fellow TAs (especially <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q5EDXpkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jennifer</a>, whose
office hours slot was right before mine and always stayed overtime
to help me with the queue) for making it so enjoyable. I am also
grateful to all my students for their great questions and being able to mentor
their impressive projects, and for giving me the opportunity to grow as a TA.</p>

<p>I also continued staying in an advisory role for
<a href="https://autolabproject.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Autolab</a>, being generally quite hands-off.
<a href="https://michellexliu.me/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michelle</a> was the project lead this semester and did
a terrific job. This being my last semester, I will dearly miss the team when I
graduate.</p>

<p>I did booth with <a href="https://cmussa.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SSA</a> again this year, and contributed mainly 
to the mechanical team and design teams. We built a Blitz booth themed after Singaporeâs
<a href="https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gardens by the Bay</a> and came in runnerâs up, after 
a well-deserved win by <a href="https://www.cmujsa.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSA</a>.</p>

<p>Academically, this semester was rather risky for me because I did not have the necessary
prerequisites for over half of my classes. I was missing
<a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">36-705 Intermediate Statistics</a>
for <a href="#course10716">10-716</a>, <a href="#course36708">36-708</a>, <a href="#course36709">36-709</a>, 
and missing <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/sj/teaching/2022-23/720-measure/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">21-720 Measure Theory and Integration</a> for [21-640]. 
It was also a difficult and tiring process to get into <a href="#course36709">36-709</a> as
the class was a required stats Ph.D. course that was generally very full, and
they had no reservations for CS majors. I ended up reading through some of the
lecture notes of <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">36-705</a>
over the winter break before the semester began to insure against the worst-case
scenario.</p>

<p>I ended up dropping 21-640 Functional Analysis halfway through the semester
as it became increasingly difficult to do (and even understand) the homework without
the necessary measure theory background.
While 21-720 was not listed as a prerequisite
on SIO for this course, it was announced as such (along with <a href="#course21640">21-640 General
Topology</a>) by the instructor during the first class, so as to
motivate and develop many of the more interesting applications in the subject.</p>

<p>This concludes my wonderful time at CMU, and I leave with many beautiful
memories. Thank you to my professors who showed me the bountiful fields of their
intellectual gardens and sparked a lifelong joy and insatiable desire in this
student of wanting to explore more of it; to my friends who colored my life with
love and laughter through our journey of growth and humility, I hope we will
stay lifelong friends; and finally to my family for always being so
unconditionally supportive and for providing a safe harbor for me to turn to any
time.</p>

    <p>Woodruff is one of the giants in sketching and numerical linear algebra, having developed many of its most important algorithms.
There is even a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sklearn</code> function called the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.clarkson_woodruff_transform.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Clarkson-Woodruff transform</a> that is named after him.</p>

    <p>His teaching is extremely clear as he makes sure to justify and explain every step used in a proof. The analysis for many
sketching algorithms is highly non-trivial, but Woodruff manages to pull off explaining it in a way that reads like a storybook.
He cares deeply about the class and the studentâs learning, and one thing that still amazes me to this day is how he will respond to my
Piazza questions on a weekend in 2 minutes consistently. I even made a <a href="https://t.co/zSg7KwmJkN" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meme about it</a>.</p>

    <p>The homework problems are long but rewarding, and you will become intimately
familiar with all sorts of linear algebra manipulations and properties.</p>

    <p>One caveat is that the weekly lectures are 3-hours with a 10-minute break in the middle. Given how dense the lectures are, this can be quite
taxing, so bring snacks or caffeine if needed.</p>

    <p>I had limited exposure to most of the topics in this course (mostly from
Theoristâs Toolkit 15-751, Graduate Complexity Theory 15-855, and Graph Theory
21-484) such as spectral graph theory, expander graphs, derandomization, etc,
and this course helped to solidify and reinforce my understanding.
It also proved a lot of things that did not have time to be proved in those earlier classes.
Overall I felt that Pravesh is a great lecturer, and the topics covered are very interesting
and applicable. The course was offered for the first time this semester, so there
were a few rough edges (i.e in the proof of Cheegerâs inequality he initially
did not want to prove it in terms of the Laplacian of the graph to avoid
introducing unnecessary concepts and notation, but doing so ended up being more confusing
than helpful), but overall it is an excellent class. The homework problems
are reasonable and the workload is on the lighter side.</p>

    <p>This class has a reputation of being one of the hardest ML classes, but I
think it is actually an excellent class that is very well-taught, so I hope
that this reputation does not discourage people interested in the content from
taking it. The class can be categorized into three module: representation,
inference, and learning. In the representation module, you will learn about
how joint distributions of several variables can be represented efficiently by
various models, taking into factors such as causal relationships. In the
inference module, you will learn that sampling from such models is very hard
in general (assuming \(\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}\)), and develop probabilistic ways of
sampling from them such as Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain and Variational Inference methods.
In the final module, you will learn how such models can be fitted to training data.
Graphical models form the backbone of many modern machine learning techniques like
generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models, and the way that
Andrej teaches all of these topics in a rigorous way to provide a solid
mathematical understanding of how they work is essential for keeping up
to date with the state-of-the-art in this field.</p>

    <p>This course covered many topics in AI which are typically not covered in a
machine learning course, such as normal and extensive form games, various
forms of equilibriums in games, solving for such equilibriums, learning in
games (regret matching), decision theories, and mechanism design.
In fact, a lot of it comes from economic theory.</p>

    <p>The content was interesting, but I did not enjoy this course as much as I
would have liked because the way that the content was presented was
relatively hand-wavey, trading depth for breadth. That said, the course is
being offered for the first time, so it will probably improve in subsequent
iterations.</p>

    <p>Ruslan is one of the household names in the machine learning community (he
invented the Dropout technique to prevent overfitting which is now standard in
neural network architectures), and I was very excited to be able to take this
class with such a legend in the field. I really enjoy his lectures, and he
made many remarks about what was happening in the field when various
techniques were being introduced as he was introducing them, which really
gives you a sense of how the field has evolved over the last few decades from
a man who has seen and been through it all.</p>

    <p>However, I think the course infrastructure requires more improvement. Some of
the starter code for the assignments are quite poorly written and contain many
inconsistencies and wrong/outdated documentation, which leads to a fair amount
of frustration from students. One particularly annoying inconsistency was how
the data formats of their starter code were transposed from Homework 1 to
Homework 2. My guess is that someone tried to update the assignment but
did not have time to fully go through to fix all the inconsistencies before
it was released.</p>

    <p>Many people ask about whether they should take 11-485/785 (Introduction to
Deep Learning) offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), or this
class offered by the Machine Learning Department (MLD). The main difference is
that 11-485/785 is more hands-on and practical (most assignments are working
on Kaggle datasets), whereas 10-417/617 is more
theoretical.</p>

    <p>The first half of the course follows the standard Sutton and Barto
textbook pretty closely, but the second half discusses topics
and techniques that are relatively state-of-the-art (think within the last
3 years). As such, there is not really any reference material other
than the papers that those techniques were based on.</p>

    <p>There are usually 2-4 papers that are compulsory readings assigned to be read
before every lecture.  Unfortunately I was a bad student and did not read them
beforehand, and so after the middle of the semester once the content went
beyond any standard textbooks, I found it pretty hard to focus and understand
what is going on in the class, and got very little out of lecture. Eventually
I had to rewatch them after reading through the papers again to be able to
properly appreciate it. So if you taking this class, please avoid my mistake
and do your readings before the lecture to save time in the long run!</p>

    <p>The homework for this class is really fun as you get to implement
reinforcement learning algorithms for agents in various OpenAI Gym
environments. All assignments are done in groups of up to 3, so remember to
grab a friend or two if youâre taking this class.</p>

    <p>This class generalizes many concepts that is taught in an undergraduate
analysis course from metric spaces in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to arbitrary
topological spaces. It took some time for me to un-learn some of the things
that I implicitly assumed was just always true, i.e while in a metric space
you learn that all sequences contains a convergent subsequences in compact
sets, this is no longer true in arbitrary topological spaces. Much of the content
have connections and parallels to other deeper areas of mathematics, which
I found very beautiful.</p>

    <p>This course felt like an MBA class. It is a required class for Masters of Software
Engineering (MSE) students, and one thing that I did not expect was how much
the course was geared towards international students (i.e there was quite some
emphasis on what is appropriate for US customs and norms), which is
understandable as most of the MSE students taking the class are international.</p>

    <p>I found the segments about how to give oral presentations useful, especially
the many tips and things to take note of when presenting.
However, I donât think I gained as much from other topics, such as those
concerning written communication.</p>

    <p>Every Monday night, the entire MSCS cohort will gather for this course, where
Dave will talk about topics ranging from classes to grad school to things to
do in Pittsburgh. Itâs usually pretty funny because Dave has a great sense of
humor, but many of the sessions are also not critically useful so
attendance does being tapering off in the middle of the semester once
people start getting busy with school.</p>

</ul>

<p>Units: 90</p>

<p>This was a really heavy semester for me, mainly because I had to juggle 4 group
projects (Deep Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Cooperative AI,
Algorithms for Big Data) simultaneously starting from the midpoint of the
semester, and all of them were significant course undertakings which are
anywhere between 30-50% of the final course grade. This is still with
homeworks from all of these classes also being due concurrently,
with the exception of Algorithms for Big Data.</p>

<p>Fortunately, all the projects turned out relatively well and I was pretty happy
with them, but it definitely took a toll on my physical and mental health. I
ended up only mostly talking to my project groupmates over the last two weeks
of school when all the projects were due. It would probably be wise to learn
from my mistake and make sure that you donât have too many classes with
significant course projects on your schedule to avoid such a situation.</p>

<h3 id="summer-2022">Summer 2022</h3>
<p>I decided to do another return internship with <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jane
Street</a>, as I had a great experience with them the
previous year. Highlights of the internship included a two-week exchange at
their London office, where I managed to catch up with many high school friends
who are now either studying or working in the UK.</p>

<p>However, in hindsight I feel that it would have been better to diversify my
internship experiences and try interning at a significantly different company
(such as a ML-focused company).  This is because internships are a relatively
low-cost 3-month investment for you to figure out what your interests are and to
learn about the problems faced by different industries. Since the internship
structure does not vary significantly between yeras, I ended up
attending a lot of similar talks and lessons for interns, which felt slightly
repetitive. Not to say that thereâs any fault with their internship, which is very
well-run and well thought-out as far as internships go - this is on purely
on the grounds of increasing my early career exposure to different types of companies.</p>

Li</a></p>

    <p>I did not enjoy 10-701 as it covered a lot of content, but did not go into much detail about many topics,
and I felt like there was no true understanding and everything was very hand-wavey. That
experience made me hesistant to take any other ML classes.</p>

    <p>10-725 changed that for me, as Yuanzhi Li started from first principles and
rigorously proved how many machine learning algorithms can converge in some
amount of steps given various assumptions. For instance, just in the
second lecture you will learn how gradient descent can converge to the optimum
up to an epsilon error in a number of states which is proportionate to a
chosen learning rate, given assumptions on the smoothness of a convex optimization
landscape. This will then be extended to more complicated settings such as stochastic gradient
descent, gradient descent with momentum (ADAM), distributed gradient descent, and even
quantum optimization.</p>

    <p>Yuanzhi Li also understands that the students taking the class have very
different learning objectives, and therefore the homework contains a mix of
required and bonus problems, where the bonus problems are usually
significantly more challenging than the required ones, but are tailored for
people who really want to get deep into this stuff. The grading policy is
extremely gentle and you essentially only have to score just half the points
on the required problems to get an A-. The late day policy is also extremely
generous (14 days), so it is quite a good class to take if you want some
flexibility in your schedule.</p>

    <p>This class aims to prepare students for doing theoretical computer science (TCS)
research in the future. It covers a wide range of topics that frequently crop up in
TCS research (see the playlist below for a taste), and the homework is challenging
but fun.
I have been previously exposed to a number of the topics covered in previous
courses, but still found many of the topics new to me such as spectral graph
theory and semidefinite relaxations incredibly cool. It is usually only
offered once every few years, so if you have any interest in doing TCS-related
research I would highly recommend that you take the class.</p>

    <p>The programming portion of the homework is the most fun part of this class.
You will get to write typecheckers and implement the dynamics of various
well-specified languages, starting from the simple lambda calculus to
concurrent Algol (which is Golang-like). This class is great for
appreciating language design and understanding the pitfalls and
antipatterns that pervades most programming languages used in industry.</p>

    <p>It is true that different sections of math classes taught by different
professors are run like entirely different classes, so your experience with
any math class highly depends on which professor you are with. I am really
glad that I took the class under Robin, whose passion for teaching, and care
and concern shown towards students (in one of the first few lectures she took
some time to have everyone introduce themselves so she can know everyone on a
more personal level), made me really enjoy the class and the subject matter.
It also helped that she followed Rudin pretty closely, so anything that I was
unclear about can be easily checked. Her weekly homework has reasonable
difficulty and is quite fun.</p>

    <p>The pace of the course under Robin is faster than most standard analysis classes,
where we covered up to Chapter 7 (Sequences and Series of Functions) in Rudin.
I enjoyed the class so much that I wanted to take another analysis class in the
future, which led me to take General Topology (21-651) in the subsequent semester.
If you are interested in taking analysis, I cannot recommend doing it with Robin
enough.</p>

Pegden</a></p>

    <p>The class was quite fast-paced and many times I felt quite lost during the
longer proofs (some of them took multiple classes to prove). I definitely had
to review the content after each lecture to get a better sense of the proof
technique. However, this is more due to the complicated setup of many of the
proofs. Wesley is a great teacher and I really appreciate how he would
re-explain the key ideas many times in different methods so that we can
understand them better. His exams are reasonable, and he will send out a
review sheet between each midterm where you are only expected to remember the
statements for some of the more complicated
theorems, instead of being able to reproduce them fully.</p>

    <p>The class covered many advanced topics in PL theory where there isnât much
publicly available resources on, so when I got confused during lecture
it was quite hard to find other materials online to supplement my learning.
Very often I would end up on the nLab wiki, and Iâm pretty sure
anyone who has visited that knows that itâs not entirely the best place
for beginners to understand anything.</p>

    <p>The class is offered pass/fail to reduce stress, and homeworks are assigned weekly.
You will be asked to re-do questions that you get wrong as Bob really wants
to make sure that you understand the material. I think I generally had
a ok-understanding of what was going on in the class until the segment on
logical frameworks, where it became very abstract. I still hope to
rectify this gap in understanding someday when I have time, perhaps by playing
around with Twelf.</p>

vision techniques covered will abuse linear algebra heavily, so if you were
not already an expert in SVD decompositions and making use of
eigenvalues/eigenvectors for engineering, this course will definitely make you

    <p>This class is similar to 54-191 Acting for Non-Majors, except with the individual
and duet performances reversed. The class was very enjoyable (though somewhat
slow-paced at times) and the workload is low. You get to perform skits like
monologues, improv, and duets in front of the class, as well as watch your
fellow classmates perform and give feedback.</p>

    <p>The class made me acutely more aware of things like body language, stage
presence, and voice projection. It gave me the observational lens required to
better critique plays and acting by others, and increased self-awareness of
how I present myself to others.</p>

    <p>Even though the class is called Acting for Business, there isnât really a huge
explicit business component to it, which I appreciated. I think the key
takeaway is to understand how you present yourself, to increase your
confidence and interpersonal communication skills, and to improve your
personal charisma.</p>

<p>This was the final semester of my undergrad, and so I made sure to spend enough
time with my friends and cherish our remaining time together on top of just
academics. We went to Las Vegas during Spring Break together, and the crazy
things we did together were truly memorable.</p>

<p>I worked on Spring Carnival <a href="https://www.springcarnival.org/booth.shtml" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">booth</a>
with <a href="https://cmussa.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SSA</a>, and we built a blitz booth with a Changi
Airport theme.  This was the first time booth has been held since the start of
the pandemic in 2020, and we lost a lot of technical know-how and tribal
knowledge about booth building from our seniors who also used to work on booth,
but have graduated since. I mainly worked on the mechanical team, doing tasks
like cutting wood, screwing frames together, and construction of the booth.
It was a really fun experience and I managed to get to know many of my juniors
in SSA much better. To put the cherry on top, our booth came in first place in our 
Blitz category!</p>

<p>On the academic side of things, I tried to make it more manageable by
watching the lectures for 10-725 and 16-385 asynchronously, which helped to
reduce the in-person fatigue levels.
Well actually, I was forced to watch it asynchronously as otherwise I had 
no time to eat lunch at all, having back-to-back classes from 10am till 4.30pm daily.</p>

<p>However, there were still several pretty crazy weeks, especially when midterms
from multiple classes lined up in a single week. Thankfully, I really enjoyed
the content from all my classes, which energized and motivated me every day.</p>

<p>It felt incredible how quickly 4 years went by. It didnât feel like too long
ago when I was still a freshman, wondering what kind of path I would take,
and what sort of impact I would make at CMU. I guess I know the answer now!</p>

relatively slowly, but then ramps up in the middle half.</p>

    <p>A curious trait of this class is that all weekly homeworks are optional, but you can turn
in two selected problems per week to offset the weightage of your midterms and final exam.
As a result, it is possible to score worse in the class if you turn in garbage for
your homework but do well on the exam. My personal recommendation and what I
did is to always do all the problems and turn in all the selected problems so that
you can receive feedback. I only missed turning in homework for one week due to
many overlapping deadlines from other classes. This approach helps you stay on
track with the class and improves your confidence of your abilities during the midterms.</p>

blockchains and distributed consensus protocols, which is one of Elaineâs major research areas.

multi-party computation, and zero-knowledge proofs, but personally I wished
that it went faster and covered more content like lattice-based and post-quantum cryptography.</p>

    <p>The course assignments are pretty fun. and thereâs many moments of instant
gratification, such as when you see your ray tracer paint a beautiful image
of light refracting through glass balls. The course staff cares deeply about
the class and thereâs a very active Discord server for the class to ask questions,
get help, and post memes. While I think I am pretty competent at systems debugging,
I found that debugging graphics code required a completely different set of
skills since the visible effect of bugs are usually the result of many
different matrix operations, which can be quite unintuitive to trace back to
the source. It was a great learning experience for me.</p>

    <p>During the first lecture, the professor talked about NAND flash alll the way
down to the gory details about how it is implemented with MOSFET cells, and
how reads, writes, and erases are performed at the voltage control level. I
knew nothing about ECE, had no idea what was going on, and thought that if
the entire course was going to be so low-level (since it is from the ECE
department after all) I was probably going to drop the class.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, that was not necessary as most of the subsequent lectures stayed
at the layer of abstraction of the software level, and therefore donât
be afraid to take this class if you are not a ECE major.</p>

    <p>There are two big assignments in the class. In the first project, you will
implement a Flash Translation Layer (FTL) for a SSD, and optimize your
implementation such that it preserves the lifespan of the SSD for as long as
possible for different workloads. This is because NAND flash can only tolerate a
certain number of erases before it fails. In the second project, you will
implement a FUSE-based filesystem (cloudFS) that automatically saves large objects
to the cloud (i.e AWS S3), performs optimizations like de-deduplicating
identical segments of stored files, and extend it to be able to
read/write large files that can fit on the cloud but not on disk
by performing segment-based read/write operations.</p>

    <p>Overall I thought it was a good class that provides you with a good sense of
where the bottlenecks of various I/O-based workloads could lie (i.e database
queries) for different filesystem designs, which is quite useful for
optimizing the performance of many real-world systems you might work on in the future.
It also gives you a good understanding of how many distributed filesystems (NFS, AFS, Google Filesystem)
and storage systems (Google BigTable) that big tech companies use works.</p>

    <p>This was my first graduate theory class, and needless to say I struggled a lot
with the homework. Interpreting the homework problem was oftentimes
a challenge in itself, and there were problems that I was stuck on for days,
which at the time was really depressing and led to me questioning my intelligence
and aptitude. However, in hindsight I grew a lot from this experience,
and the euphoria of finally solving something that you have been struggling
with for ages is indescribable. I gained a lot more confidence in my
mathematical abilities, and became better in engaging in long periods
of deep thought about a problem.</p>

Mackey ever taught another class, I will take it for sure. Mackey is just as
great and fun in Combinatorics as he was in Concepts. The homework is
challenging, and the exams even more so. After the first midterm (where the
variance was really high) he explained that he had to make the course
challenging because there were many people who already came in with a lot of
math competition background, the bulk of which involves combinatorics, and he
did not want them to be bored. Unfortunately I did not have such a background
and struggled with solving all the problems during the stressful time-crunch
of the 50 minute midterm (I canât really think creatively when I am stressed),
and this class ended up being the only B that I got in my undergraduate
career (all others A). That said, I donât really care about my GPA and my main
goal is to optimize for learning, so I am still very glad I took this class.
Not having a 4.0 also ironically gave me more courage to take a more challenging
course schedule in the future, as I no longer had to worry about losing my

    <p>I did not really enjoy this class, and felt that it tried to cover too much
too quickly, which led to a very shallow and surface-level understanding of
many topics. Maybe this is the whole point of an introductory survey class,
and maybe my lack of background in the area also led to me feeling oftentimes
very confused about what is going on. I donât feel like I remembered
a lot from this class, and none of the homework assignments were memorable.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there are not many great options for introductory ML classes.<br>
 People I knew who took the undergraduate Introduction to ML class (10-315)
complained about it being hand-wavey and not rigorous, and 10-601 is sort of
an in-between. As such, if you are a motivated and mathematically mature
student, 10-701 would still probably be your best option for an ML class.
Another choice would be 10-715, which is geared towards Ph.D students in the
Machine Learning Department (MLD) and is the fastest-paced and most
challenging option.</p>

    <p>Klaus has a reputation of trying to add abstract algebra in everything that he

Discrete Math (CDM), where he condensed a semesterâs worth of material from 21-373
Algebraic Structures covering groups, rings, and fields into two lectures, and
for good measure also threw in some discussion about Galois theory. This
culminated in a formal introduction of Polya counting, algebraic feedback
shift registers, and many other algebraic applications.</p>

    <p>There was also a lot of discussion about advanced concepts in automata theory
in the first part of the course, building upon the basics introduced in 15-251
Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science. This was his research area and
was therefore unsurprising.</p>

Design</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seth/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Seth
Goldstein</a></p>

    <p>Compilers is the other âstarâ systems class in CMU apart from OS. The best
part of the course were the labs by far. They are done in groups of 2, and
you can choose to use OCaml (best-supported, most people use this), C++ (ok
support), or Rust (very limited support, maybe better now?). Why
not be the next legend to write it in JavaScript? (please donât: reasoning will be given later). There are 6 labs
in total, with each lab depending on previous labs. They are as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 1: You will implement lexing, parsing, typechecking,
register allocation, and code generation in x86
for a very simple language that only performs arithmetic
for integers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 2: You extend the language that your compiler
can compile to boolean
expressions (including integer comparisons that results in booleans),
conditional expressions, while and for loops.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 3: The language that your compiler supports now includes
function prototypes, function declarations, typedefs.
It will be necessary to perform some tail-call optimizations to
avoid stack overflows on some of the test cases that performs
recursive calls.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 4: Your compiler must now be able to allocate/free memory
on the heap, deal with pointers &amp; deferencing, support structs
and field dereferencing/selection, support allocation
and de-allocation of fixed-sized arrays of a given type.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 5: In my opinion, this lab was the most fun. The goal is to implement
various compiler optimizations such as strength reduction, single static
assignment (SSA), improved register allocation, aggressive deadcode
elimination, partial redundancy elimination, etc. You need to beat <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc -O1</code>
in order to receive full credit, and it is possible to earn bonus points if
you can beat it further. There is a scoreboard as well, which encourages teams
to be competitive and creative with their optimizations. <br><br>
The running joke about Lab 5 is that many teams spend most of it implementing
SSA, but then run out of time to actually build optimizations on top of it.
This is because SSA is just a mechanism for transforming your intermediate
representation into a form that is more suitable for implementing many other
globla optimizations, but implementing it just by itself without optimizations
does not speed things up and instead makes your code slower since code in SSA
form is longer. <br><br>
This lab allows you to go as crazy as you want, and you can work on whatever
optimizations that interests you the most personally. For instance,
in the past there was a group that wrote an optimization to vectorize
operations using SIMD extensions. It did not really improve the
performance of the binary by a lot on most of the test cases, since
most of them are testing performance on other cases like deadcode elimination
or loop optimizations, but it was a cool project nonetheless.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 6: In the last lab, you are asked to write your own proposal
for extending your compiler, and then to implement it. My group
chose to add object-oriented features to the language, including inheritance,
access modifiers (i.e <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">private/public/protected</code>), and runtime polymorphism via vtables.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Ok, so I mentioned previously that you shouldnât use some weird language
for compilers unless you really know what you are doing. This is because
in Lab 5, the amount of time given to your compiler to compile each
file is limited. Some of the more advanced optimizations are actually
very computationally expensive, and therefore you want to make sure
that the language that you use is fast, or otherwise you know how to
make it fast. There are many teams using OCaml that lost points on Lab 5
because their compiler could not compile many of the test cases in time (this
can be avoided by optimizing your compiler code, even if itâs heap-based like
OCaml, although it might be trickier since people are generally less familiar
with how to write performant OCaml code). We also faced compiler runtime
issues with a few test cases initially even though we were on C++, but we were
able to resolve all of them by performing some optimizations.</p>

    <p>Another fun part about this course is that on top of the test cases provided
to you for each lab, you will also have to write at least 20 programs to be
submitted as test cases, which will be added to the common pool of test cases
that everyone will be evaluated on. This creates some sort of cat-and-mouse
game where over the years the tests get increasingly harder and catch even
more edge cases, and your compiler must be faster and be more robust. Some of
the test cases even revealed bugs in the reference compiler. Of course, there
is a limit to how adversarial the programs can be - the reference compiler
must be able to compile them within the time limit. Our team did something
quite evil by binary searching for the parameters determining the difficulty
of our programs that barely passes the threshold of what the reference
compiler can accept, which tripped up quite a number of other teams.</p>

    <p>Another piece of advice for this class is that you cannot afford to fall behind on any of the
labs. This is because each lab depends on the successful implementation of
previous labs, and your compiler will be run against test cases in previous
labs. In other words, if you are failing 5 test cases in Lab 2, then you will
at minimum continue to fail all 5 of them in Lab 3 because they will
re-appear. This makes it critically important to get everything right for each
lab when it is due, if not the amount of points that you lose will continue to
compound to subsequent labs.</p>

    <p>I really enjoyed 15-251 Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science under
Venkat, and decided to take this class with him as well. Undergraduate
Complexity Theory (UCT) is considered to be the follow-up class to 15-251.
The lecture pacing was quite fast, and he covered a lot of advanced topics
which would usually only be touched upon in a graduate class (i.e parameterized complexity, pseudorandomness), but all for the
better. The homeworks and exams are notoriously difficult and I ended up
spending much more time on this class than I expected to (~20 hours/week), but
it was a great preparation for the follow-up 15-855 Graduate Complexity Theory
course that I took next semester. Also, donât worry too much
about doing extremely well on his exams because they are always generously
curved at the end.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Venkat is now no longer at CMU, but has moved to Berkeley,
which in my opinion is a very great loss for CMUâs theory community.
He is truly an amazing lecturer.</p>

    <p>This is probably the most âfamousâ systems class at CMU.
The <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/lectures/L01a_OS.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">slides from the first
lecture</a> will probably give
you a good sense of how the class is like.</p>

    <p>A few pieces of advice:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Start early and aim to finish 2-3 days before the deadline. It is hard to debug a complicated kernel under stress, and you will always find a few
more bugs just when you thought you were done.</li>
      <li>Choose your partner wisely. Preferably they will be someone that
you have worked with before. Avoid choosing your significant other
as your partner - this class is very stressful and it will introduce
many fault-lines into your relationship.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I will probably write a dedicated, separate post for this class someday.</p>

    <p>Mor is absolutely amazing at teaching and in maintaining studentâs interest
during classes. She will give out chocolates in class if you answer a
question, leading to very high in-class participation. People fight
to get seated closer to the front, so that it is more likely that they
will get called on to answer questions.</p>

    <p>Aside from that, her teaching is very clear and she has a wonderfully
written textbook that accompanies the course. Homework problems
are on the challenging side, but also very fun.</p>

    <p>If you are a CS major with a strong mathematical background, you should
definitely take this class to satisfy your probability requirement instead of
taking the one from the statistics department (which is not as rigorous). This
course is tailored for CS students and covers many topics that are pervasive
in CS research, such as concentration bounds including Chernoff and Hoeffding,
classical randomized algorithms, and Markov Chains.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="course-item" id="course15260">15-260 Statistics and Computing</p>

    <p>This class is offered as a mini, meant to accompany 15-259 Probability and
Computing. It allows CS students to satisfy satistics requirement for some ML
or graduate statistics classes without having to take another introductory
statistic course.</p>

    <p>This is the main algorithms class of CMU, and Danny Sleator and Splay Trees
(which he invented) are the heart of it. Since students are expected to have
already completed several other introductory algorithms and theory classes
prior to taking this, the course covers many more advanced topics.</p>

    <p>One misconception that many people have is that they need to take 15-451
before they know âenoughâ algorithms to feel confident enough to apply for
software engineering jobs and pass the interview. Most of the content covered
in 15-451 are probably out of scope for most interviews (nobody is going to
ask you to code max-flow, or prove LP duality, or write Rabin-Miller hashing
from memory during a 30-minute interview). The only relevant topic for
interview preparation is probably dynamic programming, but given that DP
was already covered in 15-210, there is really no reason to wait for this
class.</p>

    <p>I took this class to satisfy my lab requirement. I personally thought
that this is the best class for the lab requirement for CS majors, since it
introduces you to the basics of circuits and electronics, which seems
quite useful as there are no other CS classes that does anything comparable.
One of the most memorable projects was in building a 555 timer from scratch
(not using the IC) with resistors, transistors, capacitors, and voltage
dividers. It made me realize that if debugging software was bad,
debugging hardware is on a whole new level.</p>

    <p>This was a relatively low-stress and fun class, where each week you would
watch a live play, musical, or orchestral concert, and also visit art
galleries and museums. The weekly homework is just to write a one-page
reflection of the experience, and apart from that there are only two
book reviews to complete. It was quite a good class to take to destress
from my other more demanding classes.</p>

discusses the projects of the course in detail.</p>

    <p>I personally enjoyed this class a lot and the amount of industry knowledge
that I gained from the course was like having done 3 internships back-to-back,
which happened to make it really great interview prep as well.</p>

    <p>I would recommend taking the class with friends as it is easy to get stuck in
weird errors of a complex system that you just learned, and to go for the
graduate 15-619 option if possible, as it includes a very transformative team
project that will stretch your wits in finding ways of improving the
throughput of a distributed web service in the cloud.</p>

    <p>Bryan is a great lecturer, and the course is divided into 3 portions: binary
exploitation, cryptography, and web security. I took this course because I
wanted better knowledge of topics in computer security, so that I can get better at playing Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions with
the <a href="https://pwning.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Plaid Parliament of Pwning (PPP)</a>.</p>

    <p>I personally think it is a form of gross negligence if you ever write critical
software systems without having a good understanding of computer security,
especially if you ever touch or deal with anything related to cryptography, or
maintain critical and sensitive user-facing platforms like banking systems.
The number of software engineers who still donât know the difference between
private and public keys is stupefying, and you really donât want to cause your
company to get hacked or lose customer data because of a lack of understanding
of fundamental security concepts.</p>

    <p>I found the course okay, some portions were interesting but
I donât remember being very excited by any topic in particular. I already

    <p>This is the honors version of 21-259 Calculus in Three Dimensions, and I would
recommend mathematically strong students take this (or 21-269 Vector

<p>I dropped 21-373 Algebraic Structures in the last week of classes, as the
professor who was a visiting postdoc was really poor at teaching (i.e
forgetting proofs halfway, seems very unprepared for classes, homework and exam
questions drastically different from what was covered in class),
and I thought I was going to get a B in the class. In hindsight grades
donât really matter and I should have stuck through, but ensuring that you
learn under a good professor is also really important. The experience made me
avoid math classes for a while as I wanted to make sure any future math class I took
was taught by a good professor.</p>

Engineering intern on the Infrastructure Management Team.  My mentor and I
became great friends, and we still regularly keep in touch many years on.</p>

in the course depended on that, and it was required for the weekly homework. I
would say that taking this concurrently with 15-150 definitely made 15-150
much easier, but at the time I was also pretty lost during many of the
lectures in this class. Somehow I was able to complete all the programming
assignments despite understanding very little from the lecture, which goes to
show how much a strongly typed functional language can inform and guide your
code. It was only a few years later after having taken both 15-312
Foundations of Programming Languages and 15-317 Constructive Logic that I
could fully appreciate much of the content in hindsight.</p>

    <p>It is said that the best predictor of a studentâs success is how well
they did in 15-151. Having been through the whole process,
I can testify that it is indeed true. Much of computer science depends
on math, and you need a strong and firm foundation in discrete
mathematics and proof writing in order to succeed in all subsequent classes.</p>

    <p>Seriousness aside, Mackey is an amazing lecturer. In fact, I would go so far
as to say his lectures are more like a performance, full of wit and humor. I
will always remember how after the first lecture everyone stood up and gave
him a standing ovation. I believe that was the first and only time I have ever
seen 200 students in a packed lecture hall give a standing ovation after a

    <p>I could not transfer AP credit from A-Level H2 Mathematics as the SEAB course code
changed while I was serving National Service as they modified the syllabus and
split it into H2 Further Mathematics and H2 Mathematics, and was therefore
forced to take the class by my first-year advisor. It was honestly largely a
waste of time, but it was also the only class that I took at CMU where I was
classmates with a lot of college football players.
It was quite funny because I was the
only Asian kid in the class, and since I already knew all the content, I would
always go up to the blackboard and write up the answers to all the TAâs
questions during recitation, to the applause of all the other kids. The whole
scene is quite stereotypical but itâs also funny, and having this experience

<p>From <a href="http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/previous/2017-2018/schoolofcomputerscience/courses/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a note regarding course numbers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each Carnegie Mellon course number begins with a two-digit prefix which
designates the department offering the course (76-xxx courses are offered by the
Department of English, etc.). Although each department maintains its own course
numbering practices, typically the first digit after the prefix indicates the
class level: xx-1xx courses are freshmen-level, xx-2xx courses are sophomore
level, etc. xx-6xx courses may be either undergraduate senior-level or
graduate-level, depending on the department. xx-7xx courses and higher are
graduate-level. Please consult the Schedule of Classes each semester for course
offerings and for any necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some of the common ones that you will see as a CS major:</p>

<ul>
  <li>15-xxx: Computer Science</li>
  <li>21-xxx: Mathematical Sciences</li>
  <li>02-xxx: Computational Biology</li>
  <li>05-xxx: Human-Computer Interaction</li>
  <li>10-xxx: Machine Learning</li>
  <li>11-xxx: Language Technologies Institute</li>
  <li>16-xxx: Robotics</li>
  <li>17-xxx: Institute for Software Research</li>
  <li>18-xxx: Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering</li>

<h3 id="overload-policy">Overload Policy</h3>

<p>In the <em>School of Computer Science</em>, students have a unit cap of 54. Unit overload requests must be submitted to your academic advisor, contingent on past academic
performance.</p>

<p>First-year students are not permitted to overload.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-stucos">What are StuCos?</h3>

<p><em>Student Taught Courses</em> (StuCos) are low-stress classes taught by other fellow students. They are pass/fail, and are always 3 units each. These are usually fun and interesting topics, such as lockpicking, stand-up comedy, esoteric programming languages, etc.</p>

<h3 id="special-topics-courses">Special Topics Courses</h3>

<p>The Computer Science Department offers Special Topics in Theory courses,
numbered 15-859. The section numbers differentiate the specific course.
For instance, 15-859 CC is Algorithms for Big Data.</p>

<p>These are irregularly-offered courses targeted at people intending to pursue
research in the field.</p>
