            <p class="post-description">Reviews and Recommendations for Computer Science and Math Courses at CMU</p>
          </header>

          <article>
            <p>Here I share my thoughts on the courses that I took at Carnegie Mellon
University. Note that my experiences with some of these courses can be highly
dependent on the professors, or due to the impact of virtual classes during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Do also check out the <a href="/cmu-online/">CMU Online page</a> for a curation of courses whose lectures
and course content are publicly available.</p>

<p>Courses with a â­ are those that I found transformative,
and those with a â¤ï¸ are those that I enjoyed a lot.</p>

<p>I donât write much about the more popular introductory or required
courses, since thereâs already a lot of word about it on the street and there
isnât much for me to add which already hasnât been said.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask any questions about the courses at CMU, including those that I
have not taken, in the comments section below.</p>

<p>Inspiration for this page came from <a href="https://wanshenl.me/courses/reviews/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wan Shenâs CMU course review page</a>.</p>

<p>This page was recently updated on 11/9/2022 to help students decide the classes
they may want to take ahead of course registration week.</p>

<h2 id="categories">Categories</h2>

<p>For ease of navigation, Iâve also categorized the classes that Iâve taken into
the areas that they fall under, so you can just access the ones that
you might be interested in directly.</p>

    <p>The highlight of this class were 3 different mock negotiation scenarios
that you had to roleplay and perform
I really enjoyed the negotiation exercises
in particular, they were very exciting and put me in the shoes of roles that I
would have never imagined playing them before. Nick is a very enthusiastic
teacher, his lectures are very clear and well-paced, and itâs clear he has
done this so many times that itâs almost like a rehearsed performance that
flows so smoothly. Thanks for a great semester!</p>

<p>I TAâd for <a href="https://andrejristeski.github.io/10708-S23/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">10-708 Probabilistic Graphical
Models</a> under <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Andrej
Risteski</a> this semester.</p>

<p>I dropped 21-640 Functional Analysis halfway through the semester, as this
iteration of the course offering depended on knowledge of content from 21-720 Measure Theory and Integration
in order to motivate and develop many of the more interesting applications in the subject.
I was trying to binge-watch <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/sj/teaching/2020-21/720-measure/lectures.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recorded
lecture</a>
videos from a past offering of
Measure Theory and
Integration](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/sj/teaching/2020-21/720-measure/lectures.html)
taught by Gautam Iyer during the Covid semester in the first month of the semester,
which helped for a few weeks but eventually was still insufficient 
as you really had to also work through all the homework in order
to truly understand the material and know how to apply it.  The other
requirement for the course is fundamentals in topology, i.e. first half of 21-640 General
Topology which I took the previous semester.</p>

<p>Reviews for this semester will be updated soon :)</p>

<h3 id="fall-2022">Fall 2022</h3>

<ul class="first-course-item" id="course15859CC">
  <li>
    <p>â­ 15-859 CC Â  <strong><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/teaching/15859-fall22/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Algorithms for Big Data</a></strong>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">David Woodruff</a></p>

    <p>Woodruff is one of the giants in sketching and numerical linear algebra, having developed many of its most important algorithms.
There is even a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sklearn</code> function called the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.clarkson_woodruff_transform.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Clarkson-Woodruff transform</a> that is named after him.</p>

    <p>His teaching is extremely clear as he makes sure to justify and explain every step used in a proof. The analysis for many
sketching algorithms is highly non-trivial, but Woodruff manages to pull off explaining it in a way that reads like a storybook.
He cares deeply about the class and the studentâs learning, and one thing that still amazes me to this day is how he will respond to my
Piazza questions on a weekend in 2 minutes consistently. I even made a <a href="https://t.co/zSg7KwmJkN" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meme about it</a>.</p>

    <p>The homework problems are long but rewarding, and you will become intimately
familiar with all sorts of linear algebra manipulations and properties.</p>

    <p>One caveat is that the weekly lectures are 3-hours with a 10-minute break in the middle. Given how dense the lectures are, this can be quite
taxing, so bring snacks or caffeine if needed.</p>

    <p>I had limited exposure to most of the topics in this course (mostly from
Theoristâs Toolkit 15-751, Graduate Complexity Theory 15-855, and Graph Theory
21-484) such as spectral graph theory, expander graphs, derandomization, etc,
and this course helped to solidify and reinforce my understanding.
It also proved a lot of things that did not have time to be proved in those earlier classes.
Overall I felt that Pravesh is a great lecturer, and the topics covered are very interesting
and applicable. The course was offered for the first time this semester, so there
were a few rough edges (i.e in the proof of Cheegerâs inequality he initially
did not want to prove it in terms of the Laplacian of the graph to avoid
introducing new concepts and notation, but doing so ended up being more confusing
than helpful), but overall it is quite a good class. The homework problems
are reasonable and the workload is on the lighter side.</p>

    <p class="course-item" id="course10708">â­ 10-708 Â  <strong><a href="https://andrejristeski.github.io/10708-F22/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Probablistic Graphical Models</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Andrej Risteski</a></p>

    <p>This class has a reputation of being one of the hardest ML classes, but I
think it is actually an excellent class that is very well-taught, so I hope
that this reputation does not discourage people interested in the content from
taking it. The class can be categorized into three module: representation,
inference, and learning. In the representation module, you will learn about
how joint distributions of several variables can be represented efficiently by
various models, taking into factors such as causal relationships. In the
inference module, you will learn that sampling from such models is very hard
in general (assuming \(\P \neq \NP\)), and develop probabilistic ways of
sampling from them such as Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain and Variational Inference methods.
In the final module, you will learn how such models can be fitted to training data.
Graphical models form the backbone of many modern machine learning techniques like
generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models, and the way that
Andrej teaches all of these topics in a rigorous way to provide a solid
mathematical understanding of how they work is essential for keeping up
to date with the state-of-the-art in this field.</p>

    <p class="course-item" id="course15784">15-784 Â  <strong><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15784/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Foundations of Cooperative AI</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~conitzer/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vincent Conitzer</a>, <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/coesterh/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Caspar Oesterheld</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tuomas Sandholm</a></p>

    <p>This course covered many topics in AI which are typically not covered in a
machine learning course, such as normal and extensive form games, various
forms of equilibriums in games, solving for such equilibriums, learning in
games (regret matching), decision theories, and mechanism design.
In fact, a lot of it comes from economic theory.</p>

    <p>The content was interesting, but I did not enjoy this course as much as I
would have liked because the way that the content was presented was
relatively hand-wavey, trading depth for breadth. That said, the course is
being offered for the first time, so it will probably improve in subsequent
iterations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="course-item" id="course10617">10-617 Â  <strong><a href="https://rsalakhucmu.github.io/10417-22/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Intermediate Deep Learning</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ruslan Salakhutdinov</a></p>

    <p>Ruslan is one of the household names in the machine learning community (he
invented the Dropout technique to prevent overfitting which is now standard in
neural network architectures), and I was very excited to be able to take this
class with such a legend in the field. I really enjoy his lectures, and he
made many remarks about what was happening in the field when various
techniques were being introduced as he was introducing them, which really
gives you a sense of how the field has evolved over the last few decades from
a man who has seen and been through it all.</p>

    <p>However, I think the course infrastructure requires more improvement. Some of
the starter code for the assignments are quite poorly written and contain many
inconsistencies and wrong/outdated documentation, which leads to a fair amount
of frustration from students. One particularly annoying inconsistency was how
the data formats of their starter code were transposed from Homework 1 to
Homework 2. My guess is that someone tried to update the assignment but
did not have time to fully go through to fix all the inconsistencies before
it was released.</p>

    <p>Many people ask about whether they should take 11-485/785 (Introduction to
Deep Learning) offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), or this
class offered by the Machine Learning Department (MLD). The main difference is
that 11-485/785 is more hands-on and practical (most assignments are working
on Kaggle datasets), whereas 10-417/617 is more
theoretical.</p>

    <p>The first half of the course follows the standard Sutton and Barto
textbook pretty closely, but the second half discusses topics
and techniques that are relatively state-of-the-art (think within the last
3 years). As such, there is not really any reference material other
than the papers that those techniques were based on.</p>

    <p>There are usually 2-4 papers that are compulsory readings assigned to be read
before every lecture.  Unfortunately I was a bad student and did not read them
beforehand, and so after the middle of the semester once the content went
beyond any standard textbooks, I found it pretty hard to focus and understand
what is going on in the class, and got very little out of lecture. Eventually
I had to rewatch them after reading through the papers again to be able to
properly appreciate it. So if you taking this class, please avoid my mistake
and do your readings before the lecture to save time in the long run!</p>

    <p>The homework for this class is really fun as you get to implement
reinforcement learning algorithms for agents in various OpenAI Gym
environments. All assignments are done in groups of up to 3, so remember to
grab a friend or two if youâre taking this class.</p>

    <p>This class generalizes many concepts that is taught in an undergraduate
analysis course from metric spaces in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to arbitrary
topological spaces. It took some time for me to un-learn some of the things
that I implicitly assumed was just always true, i.e while in a metric space
you learn that all sequences contains a convergent subsequences in compact
sets, this is no longer true in arbitrary topological spaces. Much of the content
have connections and parallels to other deeper areas of mathematics, which
I found very beautiful.</p>

    <p>This course felt like an MBA class. It is a required class for Masters of Software
Engineering (MSE) students, and one thing that I did not expect was how much
the course was geared towards international students (i.e there was quite some
emphasis on what is appropriate for US customs and norms), which is
understandable as most of the MSE students taking the class are international.</p>

    <p>I found the segments about how to give oral presentations useful, especially
the many tips and things to take note of when presenting.
However, I donât think I gained as much from other topics, such as those
concerning written communication.</p>

    <p>Every Monday night, the entire MSCS cohort will gather for this course, where
Dave will talk about topics ranging from classes to grad school to things to
do in Pittsburgh. Itâs usually pretty funny because Dave has a great sense of
humor, but many of the sessions are also not critically useful so
attendance does being tapering off in the middle of the semester once
people start getting busy with school.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Units: 90</p>

<p>This was a really heavy semester for me, mainly because I had to juggle 4 group
projects (Deep Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Cooperative AI,
Algorithms for Big Data) simultaneously starting from the midpoint of the
semester, and all of them were significant course undertakings which are
anywhere between 30-50% of the final course grade. This is still with
homeworks from all of these classes also being due concurrently,
with the exception of Algorithms for Big Data.</p>

<p>Fortunately, all the projects turned out relatively well and I was pretty happy
with them, but it definitely took a toll on my physical and mental health. I
ended up only mostly talking to my project groupmates over the last two weeks
of school when all the projects were due. It would probably be wise to learn
from my mistake and make sure that you donât have too many classes with
significant course projects on your schedule to avoid such a situation.</p>

<ul class="first-course-item" id="course10725">
  <li>
    <p>â­ 10-725 Â  <strong>Convex Optimization</strong>, <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuanzhil/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yuanzhi
Li</a></p>

    <p>I did not enjoy 10-701 as it covered a lot of content, but did not go into much detail about many topics,
and I felt like there was no true understanding and everything was very hand-wavey. That
experience made me hesistant to take any other ML classes.</p>

    <p>10-725 changed that for me, as Yuanzhi Li started from first principles and
rigorously proved how many machine learning algorithms can converge in some
amount of steps given various assumptions. For instance, just in the
second lecture you will learn how gradient descent can converge to the optimum
up to an epsilon error in a number of states which is proportionate to a
chosen learning rate, given assumptions on the smoothness of a convex optimization
landscape. This will then be extended to more complicated settings such as stochastic gradient
descent, gradient descent with momentum (ADAM), distributed gradient descent, and even
quantum optimization.</p>

    <p>Yuanzhi Li also understands that the students taking the class have very
different learning objectives, and therefore the homework contains a mix of
required and bonus problems, where the bonus problems are usually
significantly more challenging than the required ones, but are tailored for
people who really want to get deep into this stuff. The grading policy is
extremely gentle and you essentially only have to score just half the points
on the required problems to get an A-. The late day policy is also extremely
generous (14 days), so it is quite a good class to take if you want some
flexibility in your schedule.</p>

    <p>This class aims to prepare students for doing theoretical computer science (TCS)
research in the future. It covers a wide range of topics that frequently crop up in
TCS research (see the playlist below for a taste), and the homework is challenging
but fun.
I have been previously exposed to a number of the topics covered in previous
courses, but still found many of the topics new to me such as spectral graph
theory and semidefinite relaxations incredibly cool. It is usually only
offered once every few years, so if you have any interest in doing TCS-related
research I would highly recommend that you take the class.</p>

    <p>Recordings from a past offering of the course can be found on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3J0oaFux3ZYpFLwwrlv_EHH9wtH6pnX" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Youtube

You will get to write typecheckers and implement the dynamics of various
well-specified languages, starting from the simple lambda calculus to
concurrent Algol (which is Golang-like). This class is great for
appreciating language design and understanding the pitfalls and
antipatterns that pervades most programming languages used in industry.</p>

professors are run like entirely different classes, so your experience with
any math class highly depends on which professor you are with. I am really
glad that I took the class under Robin, whose passion for teaching, and care
and concern shown towards students (in one of the first few lectures she took
some time to have everyone introduce themselves so she can know everyone on a
more personal level), made me really enjoy the class and the subject matter.
It also helped that she followed Rudin pretty closely, so anything that I was
unclear about can be easily checked. Her weekly homework has reasonable
difficulty and is quite fun.</p>

    <p>The pace of the course under Robin is faster than most standard analysis classes,
where we covered up to Chapter 7 (Sequences and Series of Functions) in Rudin.
I enjoyed the class so much that I wanted to take another analysis class in the
future, which led me to take General Topology (21-651) in the subsequent semester.
If you are interested in taking analysis, I cannot recommend doing it with Robin
enough.</p>

    <p>The class was quite fast-paced and many times I felt quite lost during the
longer proofs (some of them took multiple classes to prove). I definitely had
to review the content after each lecture to get a better sense of the proof
technique. However, this is more due to the complicated setup of many of the
proofs. Wesley is a great teacher and I really appreciate how he would
re-explain the key ideas many times in different methods so that we can
understand them better. His exams are reasonable, and he will send out a
review sheet between each midterm where you are only expected to remember the
statements for some of the more complicated
theorems, instead of being able to reproduce them fully.</p>

    <p>The textbook for the clas (Graph Theory by Diestel) is quite tersely written
as it is intended for a graduate audience, so definitely do not miss lectures!</p>

Harper</a></p>

    <p>The class covered many advanced topics in PL theory where there isnât much
publicly available resources on, so when I got confused during lecture
it was quite hard to find other materials online to supplement my learning.
Very often I would end up on the nLab wiki, and Iâm pretty sure
anyone who has visited that knows that itâs not entirely the best place
for beginners to understand anything.</p>

    <p>The class is offered pass/fail to reduce stress, and homeworks are assigned weekly.
You will be asked to re-do questions that you get wrong as Bob really wants
to make sure that you understand the material. I think I generally had
a ok-understanding of what was going on in the class until the segment on
logical frameworks, where it became very abstract. I still hope to
rectify this gap in understanding someday when I have time, perhaps by playing
around with Twelf.</p>

not already an expert in SVD decompositions and making use of
eigenvalues/eigenvectors for engineering, this course will definitely make you

    <p>This course covers the theoretical aspects of quantum computing, starting from
the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb algorithm (I bet this already got your attention) to
classical results like Shorâs and Groverâs algorithm. The class starts off initially
relatively slowly, but then ramps up in the middle half.</p>

    <p>A curious trait of this class is that all weekly homeworks are optional, but you can turn
in two selected problems per week to offset the weightage of your midterms and final exam.
As a result, it is possible to score worse in the class if you turn in garbage for
your homework but do well on the exam. My personal recommendation and what I
did is to always do all the problems and turn in all the selected problems so that
you can receive feedback. I only missed turning in homework for one week due to
many overlapping deadlines from other classes. This approach helps you stay on
track with the class and improves your confidence of your abilities during the midterms.</p>

blockchains and distributed consensus protocols, which is one of Elaineâs major research areas.

multi-party computation, and zero-knowledge proofs, but personally I wished

gratification, such as when you see your ray tracer paint a beautiful image
of light refracting through glass balls. The course staff cares deeply about
the class and thereâs a very active Discord server for the class to ask questions,
get help, and post memes. While I think I am pretty competent at systems debugging,
I found that debugging graphics code required a completely different set of
skills since the visible effect of bugs are usually the result of many
different matrix operations, which can be quite unintuitive to trace back to
the source. It was a great learning experience for me.</p>

    <p>During the first lecture, the professor talked about NAND flash alll the way
down to the gory details about how it is implemented with MOSFET cells, and
how reads, writes, and erases are performed at the voltage control level. I
knew nothing about ECE, had no idea what was going on, and thought that if
the entire course was going to be so low-level (since it is from the ECE
department after all) I was probably going to drop the class.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, that was not necessary as most of the subsequent lectures stayed
at the layer of abstraction of the software level, and therefore donât
be afraid to take this class if you are not a ECE major.</p>

    <p>There are two big assignments in the class. In the first project, you will
implement a Flash Translation Layer (FTL) for a SSD, and optimize your
implementation such that it preserves the lifespan of the SSD for as long as
possible for different workloads. This is because NAND flash can only tolerate a
certain number of erases before it fails. In the second project, you will
implement a FUSE-based filesystem (cloudFS) that automatically saves large objects
to the cloud (i.e AWS S3), performs optimizations like de-deduplicating
identical segments of stored files, and extend it to be able to
read/write large files that can fit on the cloud but not on disk
by performing segment-based read/write operations.</p>

    <p>Overall I thought it was a good class that provides you with a good sense of
where the bottlenecks of various I/O-based workloads could lie (i.e database
queries) for different filesystem designs, which is quite useful for
optimizing the performance of many real-world systems you might work on in the future.
It also gives you a good understanding of how many distributed filesystems (NFS, AFS, Google Filesystem)
and storage systems (Google BigTable) that big tech companies use works.</p>

    <p>This was my first graduate theory class, and needless to say I struggled a lot
with the homework. Interpreting the homework problem was oftentimes
a challenge in itself, and there were problems that I was stuck on for days,
which at the time was really depressing and led to me questioning my intelligence
and aptitude. However, in hindsight I grew a lot from this experience,
and the euphoria of finally solving something that you have been struggling
with for ages is indescribable. I gained a lot more confidence in my
mathematical abilities, and became better in engaging in long periods
of deep thought about a problem.</p>

Mackey ever taught another class, I will take it for sure. Mackey is just as
great and fun in Combinatorics as he was in Concepts. The homework is
challenging, and the exams even more so. After the first midterm (where the
variance was really high) he explained that he had to make the course
challenging because there were many people who already came in with a lot of
math competition background, the bulk of which involves combinatorics, and he
did not want them to be bored. Unfortunately I did not have such a background
and struggled with solving all the problems during the stressful time-crunch
of the 50 minute midterm (I canât really think creatively when I am stressed),
and this class ended up being the only B that I got in my undergraduate
career (all others A). That said, I donât really care about my GPA and my main
goal is to optimize for learning, so I am still very glad I took this class.
Not having a 4.0 also ironically gave me more courage to take a more challenging
course schedule in the future, as I no longer had to worry about losing my
perfect GPA.</p>

    <p>I did not really enjoy this class, and felt that it tried to cover too much
too quickly, which led to a very shallow and surface-level understanding of
many topics. Maybe this is the whole point of an introductory survey class,
and maybe my lack of background in the area also led to me feeling oftentimes
very confused about what is going on. I donât feel like I remembered
a lot from this class, and none of the homework assignments were memorable.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there are not many great options for introductory ML classes.<br>
 People I knew who took the undergraduate Introduction to ML class (10-315)
complained about it being hand-wavey and not rigorous, and 10-601 is sort of
an in-between. As such, if you are a motivated and mathematically mature
student, 10-701 would still probably be your best option for an ML class.
Another choice would be 10-715, which is geared towards Ph.D students in the
Machine Learning Department (MLD) and is the fastest-paced and most
challenging option.</p>

Algebraic Structures covering groups, rings, and fields into two lectures, and
for good measure also threw in some discussion about Galois theory. This
culminated in a formal introduction of Polya counting, algebraic feedback
shift registers, and many other algebraic applications.</p>

    <p>There was also a lot of discussion about advanced concepts in automata theory
in the first part of the course, building upon the basics introduced in 15-251

Design</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seth/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Seth
Goldstein</a></p>

    <p>Compilers is the other âstarâ systems class in CMU apart from OS. The best
part of the course were the labs by far. They are done in groups of 2, and
you can choose to use OCaml (best-supported, most people use this), C++ (ok
support), or Rust (very limited support, maybe better now?). Why
not be the next legend to write it in JavaScript? (please donât: reasoning will be given later). There are 6 labs
in total, with each lab depending on previous labs. They are as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 1: You will implement lexing, parsing, typechecking,
register allocation, and code generation in x86
for a very simple language that only performs arithmetic
for integers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 2: You extend the language that your compiler
can compile to boolean
expressions (including integer comparisons that results in booleans),
conditional expressions, while and for loops.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 3: The language that your compiler supports now includes
function prototypes, function declarations, typedefs.
It will be necessary to perform some tail-call optimizations to
avoid stack overflows on some of the test cases that performs
recursive calls.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 4: Your compiler must now be able to allocate/free memory
on the heap, deal with pointers &amp; deferencing, support structs
and field dereferencing/selection, support allocation
and de-allocation of fixed-sized arrays of a given type.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 5: In my opinion, this lab was the most fun. The goal is to implement
various compiler optimizations such as strength reduction, single static
assignment (SSA), improved register allocation, aggressive deadcode
elimination, partial redundancy elimination, etc. You need to beat <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc -O1</code>
in order to receive full credit, and it is possible to earn bonus points if
you can beat it further. There is a scoreboard as well, which encourages teams
to be competitive and creative with their optimizations. <br><br>
The running joke about Lab 5 is that many teams spend most of it implementing
SSA, but then run out of time to actually build optimizations on top of it.
This is because SSA is just a mechanism for transforming your intermediate
representation into a form that is more suitable for implementing many other
globla optimizations, but implementing it just by itself without optimizations
does not speed things up and instead makes your code slower since code in SSA
form is longer. <br><br>
This lab allows you to go as crazy as you want, and you can work on whatever
optimizations that interests you the most personally. For instance,
in the past there was a group that wrote an optimization to vectorize
operations using SIMD extensions. It did not really improve the
performance of the binary by a lot on most of the test cases, since
most of them are testing performance on other cases like deadcode elimination
or loop optimizations, but it was a cool project nonetheless.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lab 6: In the last lab, you are asked to write your own proposal
for extending your compiler, and then to implement it. My group
chose to add object-oriented features to the language, including inheritance,
access modifiers (i.e <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">private/public/protected</code>), and runtime polymorphism via vtables.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Ok, so I mentioned previously that you shouldnât use some weird language
for compilers unless you really know what you are doing. This is because
in Lab 5, the amount of time given to your compiler to compile each
file is limited. Some of the more advanced optimizations are actually
very computationally expensive, and therefore you want to make sure
that the language that you use is fast, or otherwise you know how to
make it fast. There are many teams using OCaml that lost points on Lab 5
because their compiler could not compile many of the test cases in time (this
can be avoided by optimizing your compiler code, even if itâs heap-based like
OCaml, although it might be trickier since people are generally less familiar
with how to write performant OCaml code). We also faced compiler runtime
issues with a few test cases initially even though we were on C++, but we were
able to resolve all of them by performing some optimizations.</p>

    <p>Another fun part about this course is that on top of the test cases provided
to you for each lab, you will also have to write at least 20 programs to be
submitted as test cases, which will be added to the common pool of test cases
that everyone will be evaluated on. This creates some sort of cat-and-mouse
game where over the years the tests get increasingly harder and catch even
more edge cases, and your compiler must be faster and be more robust. Some of
the test cases even revealed bugs in the reference compiler. Of course, there
is a limit to how adversarial the programs can be - the reference compiler
must be able to compile them within the time limit. Our team did something
quite evil by binary searching for the parameters determining the difficulty
of our programs that barely passes the threshold of what the reference
compiler can accept, which tripped up quite a number of other teams.</p>

    <p>Another piece of advice for this class is that you cannot afford to fall behind on any of the
labs. This is because each lab depends on the successful implementation of
previous labs, and your compiler will be run against test cases in previous
labs. In other words, if you are failing 5 test cases in Lab 2, then you will
at minimum continue to fail all 5 of them in Lab 3 because they will
re-appear. This makes it critically important to get everything right for each
lab when it is due, if not the amount of points that you lose will continue to
compound to subsequent labs.</p>

Venkat, and decided to take this class with him as well. Undergraduate
Complexity Theory (UCT) is considered to be the follow-up class to 15-251.
The lecture pacing was quite fast, and he covered a lot of advanced topics
which would usually only be touched upon in a graduate class (i.e parameterized complexity, pseudorandomness), but all for the
better. The homeworks and exams are notoriously difficult and I ended up
spending much more time on this class than I expected to (~20 hours/week), but
it was a great preparation for the follow-up 15-855 Graduate Complexity Theory
course that I took next semester. Also, donât worry too much
about doing extremely well on his exams because they are always generously
curved at the end.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Venkat is now no longer at CMU, but has moved to Berkeley,
which in my opinion is a very great loss for CMUâs theory community.
He is truly an amazing lecturer.</p>

    <p>The goal of this class is to encourage undergraduates to contact professors
and get into research. However, from what I saw people who already started
doing research before the class simply continued with their existing topics,
and those that were not engaged in research previously also did not continue
after the class. In other words, donât expect this class to suddenly turn you
into a researcher - the motivation must come from within.</p>

    <p>This is probably the most âfamousâ systems class at CMU.

you a good sense of how the class is like.</p>

    <p>A few pieces of advice:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Start early and aim to finish 2-3 days before the deadline. It is hard to debug a complicated kernel under stress, and you will always find a few
more bugs just when you thought you were done.</li>
      <li>Choose your partner wisely. Preferably they will be someone that
you have worked with before. Avoid choosing your significant other
as your partner - this class is very stressful and it will introduce
many fault-lines into your relationship.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I will probably write a dedicated, separate post for this class someday.</p>

    <p>Mor is absolutely amazing at teaching and in maintaining studentâs interest
during classes. She will give out chocolates in class if you answer a
question, leading to very high in-class participation. People fight
to get seated closer to the front, so that it is more likely that they
will get called on to answer questions.</p>

    <p>Aside from that, her teaching is very clear and she has a wonderfully
written textbook that accompanies the course. Homework problems
are on the challenging side, but also very fun.</p>

    <p>If you are a CS major with a strong mathematical background, you should
definitely take this class to satisfy your probability requirement instead of
taking the one from the statistics department (which is not as rigorous). This
course is tailored for CS students and covers many topics that are pervasive
in CS research, such as concentration bounds including Chernoff and Hoeffding,
classical randomized algorithms, and Markov Chains.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="course-item" id="course15260">15-260 Statistics and Computing</p>

    <p>This class is offered as a mini, meant to accompany 15-259 Probability and
Computing. It allows CS students to satisfy satistics requirement for some ML
or graduate statistics classes without having to take another introductory
statistic course.</p>

    <p>This is the main algorithms class of CMU, and Danny Sleator and Splay Trees
(which he invented) are the heart of it. Since students are expected to have
already completed several other introductory algorithms and theory classes
prior to taking this, the course covers many more advanced topics.</p>

    <p>One misconception that many people have is that they need to take 15-451
before they know âenoughâ algorithms to feel confident enough to apply for
software engineering jobs and pass the interview. Most of the content covered
in 15-451 are probably out of scope for most interviews (nobody is going to
ask you to code max-flow, or prove LP duality, or write Rabin-Miller hashing
from memory during a 30-minute interview). The only relevant topic for
interview preparation is probably dynamic programming, but given that DP
was already covered in 15-210, there is really no reason to wait for this
class.</p>

    <p>I took this class to satisfy my lab requirement. I personally thought
that this is the best class for the lab requirement for CS majors, since it
introduces you to the basics of circuits and electronics, which seems
quite useful as there are no other CS classes that does anything comparable.
One of the most memorable projects was in building a 555 timer from scratch
(not using the IC) with resistors, transistors, capacitors, and voltage
dividers. It made me realize that if debugging software was bad,
debugging hardware is on a whole new level.</p>

    <p>This was a relatively low-stress and fun class, where each week you would
watch a live play, musical, or orchestral concert, and also visit art
galleries and museums. The weekly homework is just to write a one-page
reflection of the experience, and apart from that there are only two
book reviews to complete. It was quite a good class to take to destress
from my other more demanding classes.</p>

    <p>I personally enjoyed this class a lot and the amount of industry knowledge
that I gained from the course was like having done 3 internships back-to-back,
which happened to make it really great interview prep as well.</p>

    <p>I would recommend taking the class with friends as it is easy to get stuck in
weird errors of a complex system that you just learned, and to go for the
graduate 15-619 option if possible, as it includes a very transformative team

    <p>Bryan is a great lecturer, and the course is divided into 3 portions: binary
exploitation, cryptography, and web security. I took this course because I
wanted better knowledge of topics in computer security, so that I can get better at playing Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions with
the <a href="https://pwning.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Plaid Parliament of Pwning (PPP)</a>.</p>

    <p>I personally think it is a form of gross negligence if you ever write critical
software systems without having a good understanding of computer security,
especially if you ever touch or deal with anything related to cryptography, or
maintain critical and sensitive user-facing platforms like banking systems.
The number of software engineers who still donât know the difference between
private and public keys is stupefying, and you really donât want to cause your
company to get hacked or lose customer data because of a lack of understanding
of fundamental security concepts.</p>

<p>I dropped 21-373 Algebraic Structures in the last week of classes, as the
professor who was a visiting postdoc was really poor at teaching (i.e
forgetting proofs halfway, seems very unprepared for classes, homework and exam
questions drastically different from what was covered in class),
and I thought I was going to get a B in the class. In hindsight grades
donât really matter and I should have stuck through, but ensuring that you
learn under a good professor is also really important. The experience made me
avoid math classes for a while as I wanted to make sure any future math class I took
was taught by a good professor.</p>

much easier, but at the time I was also pretty lost during many of the
lectures in this class. Somehow I was able to complete all the programming
assignments despite understanding very little from the lecture, which goes to
show how much a strongly typed functional language can inform and guide your
code. It was only a few years later after having taken both 15-312

I can testify that it is indeed true. Much of computer science depends
on math, and you need a strong and firm foundation in discrete
mathematics and proof writing in order to succeed in all subsequent classes.</p>

    <p>Seriousness aside, Mackey is an amazing lecturer. In fact, I would go so far
as to say his lectures are more like a performance, full of wit and humor. I
will always remember how after the first lecture everyone stood up and gave
him a standing ovation. I believe that was the first and only time I have ever

forced to take the class by my first-year advisor. It was honestly largely a
waste of time, but it was also the only class that I took at CMU where I was

It was quite funny because I was the

always go up to the blackboard and write up the answers to all the TAâs

<p>From <a href="http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/previous/2017-2018/schoolofcomputerscience/courses/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a note regarding course numbers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each Carnegie Mellon course number begins with a two-digit prefix which
designates the department offering the course (76-xxx courses are offered by the
Department of English, etc.). Although each department maintains its own course
numbering practices, typically the first digit after the prefix indicates the
class level: xx-1xx courses are freshmen-level, xx-2xx courses are sophomore
level, etc. xx-6xx courses may be either undergraduate senior-level or
graduate-level, depending on the department. xx-7xx courses and higher are
graduate-level. Please consult the Schedule of Classes each semester for course
offerings and for any necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some of the common ones that you will see as a CS major:</p>

<ul>
  <li>15-xxx: Computer Science</li>
  <li>21-xxx: Mathematical Sciences</li>
  <li>02-xxx: Computational Biology</li>
