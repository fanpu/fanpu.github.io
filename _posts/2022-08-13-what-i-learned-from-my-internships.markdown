As I wrap up my last internship, I am filled with thoughts about the journey that I have taken and how much I've improved over the years. With the exception of Saleswhale, I have never really talked much about my experiences on this blog. 

### Saleswhale

### Asana

One of the things that struck me most was how respectful and mindful the office culture was. 

Unsurprisingly, I learned a lot about task and project management at Asana. It led me to revamp the way that Autolab

As a returning intern, you can feel that the expectations are very different. You have a much better macro-level 

You are expected 
to work very independently, be able to



What do I want to write about? I don't even know.


What's been on my mind? 

When I first started, I used to always run through major design decisions across
my mentor or other senior team members. For instance, I recalled that in Saleswhale
I would always get approval on the design of new API endpoints that I am implementing.

 This was in the spirit of kaizen, where
you want to seek feedback in an iterative process starting very early on,
allowing you to make incremental adjustments as needed and avoiding the disaster
scenario where after you finish a big undertaking, you get informed that some
major design decision was flawed, and then you have to throw out the whole thing
and start over again.

Much of the reasoning still makes sense, but over the years I realized that
there is a subtle distinction in the kinds of questions that you ask. It becomes
more important to gain a thorough understanding of the business problem that you
are solving, and to see how other parts of the system could interact and play with
the thing that you are building. 


But over the years, as I become exposed to more designs and patterns from
college classes and projects, what I noticed is that by virtue of being the
person that has spent the most time thinking about a particular problem, the
design that I come up with is already pretty good and there are mostly no
objections to it.  It must be realized that while your mentors are there to help
you, an internship is also very much an extended job interview to see how you
can perform in a real-world development environment, and therefore if you are
able to call the shots yourself it would free up a lot of resources from your
mentor/manager from having to think about these problems. This not only makes
you a more valuable team member as you are able to work independently and be trusted
to make decisions with the best of your knowledge, it also forces you to reason about
the various trade-offs yourself, which overall




Apparently another thing that happens is when you start noticing a shift from primarily asking questions to primarily answering questions.
