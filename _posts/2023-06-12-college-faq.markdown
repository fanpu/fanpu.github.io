Disclaimers: Admittedly most of these will be advice will be on "negatives" -
on myths, things that are not true, things that you should avoid falling prey to.
It is natural that you demand that I also provide some "positives", in terms of 
what I should do, and things that will work.
But given the complexity, subjectivity, and nuances
of the college admission system, it is difficult, and perhaps
even desirable, that such a template does not exist.
The whole beauty (or horror) of the system is its subjectivity.

I am generally very hesitant to say what works due to survivorship bias.
One could point to a failed college application and identify a hundred reasons why
the applicant was rejected, but then can you look at a successful college
application and definitively say that there were some critical deciding factors?


# Some (Probably) Good Advice
- probably already repeated a bunch of times by your school college admission counsellors, but here for completeness

## Making Use of Opportunities

## Not Where You Start, But Where You Finish

## Figure Out If The School Is A Good Fit For You

## Your Personal Voice

# Worries

## But There's Nothing Special About Me
- self-reflection and understanding is a long and scary journey
- some people never really know who they are or what they like until very late in their life
- good chance to do it now! not just for your college app, but for yourself. once you find out what you
love and want to do, you will have a north star guiding your every decision, and
everything else will fall into place

# Myths
In this section, I dispel some of the commonly-held myths about college applications.

## The Exceptional Talent Myth

## The Portfolio Myth
Common question: how do I stand out? how do I improve my portfolio?

- was part of a hiring committee
- shared by Dave
- "many people are good, and would be successful whereever they go.
but good is not enough. you want someone
who impresses you so much that you know you must get them"
- doing things for the sake of it is unlikely to change this aspect of you
- find some part about you that is unique to yourself
- it's all so tiring and fake

Well, how did you think you stood out?
- genuine passion for something?

## The Good Grades Myth

## The SAT Score Myth

# Dont's

## Rehashing your Resume 

## Negativity

## Portfolio Chasing

# Is It Worth It?

## Should I Take A Scholarship?
see my blog post

## Expected Value

# Strange But Reasonable Questions

## Backdoor Majors
suppose i want to apply to school X that is very good at Y, is
it advisable to apply to a less competitive major Z and then try to transfer to major Y?

## I Heard It Is Easier for People X To Get Into Program Y
- missing the point: not really because of the attribute of X, but
because of the lived experiences of people with attribute X

## Dealing with Rejection

TODO fanpu: maybe defer this to a future post

# The Bigger Picture

## Firstly, Do It For Yourself
- journey of self reflection, really precious opportunity

## Have A Bit Of Fun
- doesn't have to all be so serious, make it fun, add some humor in appropriate places

## You Can Be Successful Anywhere

- own story on getting rejected from stanford, feeling sadge

## Sometimes It Is Better To Not Achieve What You Want
> And even though I did not reach the NFL, I sometimes think I got more from
> persuing that dream, and not accomplishing it, then I did from many of the ones
> I did accomplish.

## Rejection Does Not Define Who You Are
add some quote maybe

don't let a bunch people halfway across the world tell you what you can or cannot do with your life

college, so what?
good job, so what?
good life, so what?
can you not have a good life by being satisfied with less?

## Begin With The End In Mind
