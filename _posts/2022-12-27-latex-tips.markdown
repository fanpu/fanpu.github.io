When was the first time you had to use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)?
If you are like most people, it was probably suddenly forced upon you during
your first math or CS class where you had to start writing proofs,
with minimal guidance on how to get started other than something along the
lines of``hey, check out this link on how to get things setup, and here are
some basic commands, now go wild!''.

The art of LaTeX-ing

### Use Paired Delimiters

### Make use of the `proof` environment

### Always use `\qedhere`

### `align*` environment for multiline equations

### Spacing

### Double quotes

### Non-breaking lines

### Epsilons

### Dots

### Mid

### Angle Brackets

### Math Operators

### `\textnormal`

### Non-breaking space with `~`
