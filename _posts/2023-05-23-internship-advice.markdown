## Freshmen Internships
Make no mistake, the odds are heavily stacked against you during your first year of college.
Most companies are (understandably) looking for candidates who will be able to start
a year or two after their internships, and therefore it is challenging to
even get any callbacks. However, there are a couple of things that you can consider
do make your summer rich and rewarding.

### 1. Working at Startups
Startups are always hungry for talent. They are traditionally overlooked by most
applicants who are looking for a more stable, well-known, or higher-playing
place, but in fact can offer an unparalleled experience in terms of the breadth
of experience across various functions that you will gain, the impact that you
can leave (even as an intern), and friendships that you will make.

### 2. Summer School
Another popular option is to take summer classes and to get ahead of your peers. At CMU, 
this is most commonly classes like 15-122, 150150, and 15-213. Being able to clear 15-213
early is especially valuable as it is a gatekeeper class that will unlock all systems
classes, in addition to many other classes with significant programming projects that
list 15-213 as a pre-requisite.

### 3. 


 <!-- and people who are willing to pick up things fast -->

However, do not despair because there are also many other options available to you which
you may not have considered otherwise.
