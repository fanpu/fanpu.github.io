Rhythm is just a $200 controller and some hopefully-not-too-complicated
open source software setup away!

This beginner's guide will help to demystify the process of setting up Sound Voltex
at home using a custom SDVX controller using Unnamed SDVX Clone.

---

My foray into rhythm games started way
back with [Love Live! School Idol Festival](https://lovelive-sif-global.bushimo.jp/).
While the game has sadly since shut down, other
titles I've played
include [BanG Dream!](https://bang-dream-gbp-en.bushiroad.com/)
and [Project SEKAI](https://projectsekai.fandom.com/wiki/Project_SEKAI_COLORFUL_STAGE!).

When I visited Japan a few months ago in the summer, I discovered [Sound Voltex](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/sdvx/sv/p/index.html), and instantly
fell in love with its unique control system and beautiful flashy graphics:

{% include figure.html 
    path="/assets/img/posts/sdvx/sdvx_and_me.webp"
    width="400px"
    class="z-depth-1"
%}

In Japan, you pay 100 yen (~$0.68 USD) to play two to three songs. You get to
play three songs if you don't crash (i.e fail) any tracks, and two if you fail
on either of the first two guaranteed plays.

Rhythm games in general are sadly not as mainstream outside of Japan.
For instance, in Singapore I was only aware of a single arcade that had Sound Voltex cabs,
even though arcades are quite popular in general. Similarly, in NYC, there's only a single 
small arcade called [Chinatown Fair](http://www.chinatownfair.biz/) that has Sound Voltex.
So naturally I wanted to see if I could set it up at home to continue enjoying the game.

(Apparently, if you have a lot of disposable income and space in your living
room, you can also just buy an entire [previous-generation Sound Voltex
cabinet](https://www.hadouken-arcade.com/products/sound-voltex-vivid-wave) for a
few thousand dollars)

## Why This Guide
I decided to write this guide since the setup process could seem somewhat daunting for
people who are interested in rhythm games but are not developers. Hopefully
now more people will also be able to play and enjoy this game.

The setup process is very straightforward on Windows, but has a few subtle
points on macOS and Linux that I'll point out.

## Setup Specification
This guide will use the following setup:

- Game: [unnamed-sdvx-clone](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone), commonly abbreviated USC
- Controller: [Yuancon SDVX controller](https://yuancon.store/controller/sdvxblack).

While I performed the setup on macOS, the instructions are largely the same
for Linux based systems as well. In fact, if you are already 
regardless of which controller or OS you use.

## Installing Unnamed SDVX Clone

### Windows
The setup process for Windows is very straightforward.
You should just download the [latest Windows build](https://drewol.me/Downloads/Game.zip) as linked on the [Github page](https://drewol.me/Downloads/Game.zip), and run `usc-game.exe` to start the game.

### macOS

This is mostly just from the [official instructions](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone#macos),
but with implicit points made explicit:

1.  If you don't have [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/) on your machine yet, install it by 
[following the instructions here](https://brew.sh/). Homebrew is a package management software.
2.  If you don't have [git](https://git-scm.com/) yet, install it with Homebrew:

    ```bash
    $ brew install git
    ```

    Git is a version control system (normally used for code). In our case, we use it mainly to obtain
    the project dependencies.
3.  Clone the `unnamed-sdvx-clone` with `git`:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone
    ```

    This will result in the game being downloaded to a `unnamed-sdvx-clone` folder
    in your current working directory.

4.  Navigate into the new folder, and download the submodules of the project:

    ```bash
    $ cd unnamed-sdvx-clone
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

    This is necessary because the game has third-party dependencies, which are
    tracked as [other Github repositories](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone/blob/develop/.gitmodules).

5.  Install more dependencies required to build the project with Homebrew:

    ```bash
    $ brew install cmake freetype libvorbis sdl2 libpng jpeg libarchive libiconv
    ```

    These are all open source libraries required for the following reasons:
    - [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/): a popular build system used to compile the project
    - [`freetype`](https://freetype.org/): for rendering fonts
    - [`libvorbis`](https://xiph.org/vorbis/): audio compression
    - [`sdl2`](https://www.libsdl.org/): get access to hardware inputs like keyboard, mouse, controller, etc
    - [`libpng`](https://github.com/glennrp/libpng): for using/manipulating PNG images
    - [`jpeg`](https://www.ijg.org/): for using/manipulating JPEG images
    - [`libarchive`](https://www.libarchive.org/): compression library
    - [`libiconv`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/): convert between different character encodings (i.e [ISO-8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) to [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8))

6.  Configure the project using `cmake`. In this case, the project author
    already kindly wrapped a script around this command, so we only have to run the
    script:

    ```bash
    $ ./mac-cmake.sh
    ```

7.  Compile and build the project:

    ```bash
    $ make
    ```

    This step could take a while. If you want to speed it up, you can run it and
    specify the `-j` argument parallelize the compilation based on the number of
    cores you have (use one less than your total number of cores):

    ```bash
    $ make -j 9
    ```
  
8.  Run the game from the `bin` folder:

    ```bash
    $ cd bin
    $ ./usc-game
    ```

    It is important to run it from the `./bin` folder and not the root of the
    project directory, as some skins search for file dependencies in a relative
    manner and will hence not be able to find it.

### Linux
Honestly if you're on Linux, you should be able to figure it out by yourself 😊

## First Startup

On first startup, you should see this:

{% include video.liquid 
    path="/assets/img/posts/sdvx/sdvx-initial.webm"
    width="400px"
    class="z-depth-1"
    autoplay=true
    muted=true
    loop=true
%}

For now, you can just use your mouse to interact with the game menu.

## Configuring The Controller

Let's now setup our Yuancon controller!

1. 
    Quit the game, and unplug your SDVX controller if it is plugged in

2. 
    Hold the `START` and `BT-C` button simultaneously. The `START` button is the
    diamond-shaped button at the top, while the BT-C is the third white button from
    the left (it should also be labelled on the controller board). 

    Then while still holding down both buttons, connect it to your computer.
    This will put it in [Controller HID Mode](https://oniichan.wtf/help/index.html),
    where the controller inputs as a gamepad.

3. 
    Start up the game again, and navigate to the `Settings` page.
    Here, you want to do the following:

    - Set `Button input mode` to `Controller`
    - Set `Laser input mode` to `Controller`
    - Adjust laser sensitivity accordingly (I like `1.875`)
    - Click on each of the key bindings, and hit the corresponding
    keys on your controller. I used the button on the
    right side of the controller panel as my back button.

    You should have something that looks similar to this:

    {% include figure_simple.html 
        path="/assets/img/posts/sdvx/sdvx-settings.webp"
        width="600px"
        class="z-depth-1"
    %}

4. 
    Restart the game. You should now be able to use the knobs to cycle through
    the menus, and the buttons to activate them!

## Getting Songs
Right after setup, there are no songs to play yet. USC uses
the same chart format as [K-Shoot MANIA (KSM)](https://www.kshootmania.com/en/)

There are a few places you can get songs:

- [Nautica](https://ksm.dev/) hosts community-created KSM charts. There is also a
    menu option to download these directly from within USC.
- [Converted SDVX Charts](https://oniichan.wtf/help/songs.html): probably somewhat 
    questionable legally because of copyright and whatnot but a lot of people
    recommend and use it
- [This KSM FAQ page on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kshootmania/wiki/gettingsongs/#wiki_getting_more_songs) provides many useful links for downloading new songs

Once you have downloaded the songs, unzip and extract them if necessary,
and copy them into `./bin/songs`.

## Skinning The Game

The default skin works, but it is not very impressive:

{% include video.liquid 
    path="/assets/img/posts/sdvx/sdvx-default.webm"
    width="400px"
    class="z-depth-1"
    autoplay=true
    muted=true
    loop=true
%}

Let's try to re-create the original SDVX arcade experience with
skins. 
You can get skins for the game [here](https://oniichan.wtf/help/skins.html).
These are really high-effort and well-made, and huge thanks to the developers
and artists for making them.

Once you have downloaded the skin, extract and move them to `./bin/skins`. You
should then be able to select the skin under the `Skins` tab of the game
settings.

The UI of the skin for the game may change depending on whether your
monitor is in portrait or landscape mode. Orienting it vertically
is recommended for the best SDVX-like experience - the spaceship(?) at
the bottom only shows up when it's vertical.

Some examples of the different skins are shown below. I know, they're pretty!

(*Why are the previews so low-res? [Bandwidth costs add up!](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/its-all-about-the-bandwidth-why-many-network-intensive-services-select-digitalocean-as-their-cloud)*)

### LiqidWave

{% include video.liquid 
    path="/assets/img/posts/sdvx/vivid.webm"
    width="400px"
    class="z-depth-1"
    autoplay=true
    muted=true
    loop=true
%}

If you run into errors about shaders when trying to play a song, see the [Common
Errors](#common-errors) section below.

### ExperimentalGear

{% include video.liquid 
    path="/assets/img/posts/sdvx/experimental-gear.webm"
    width="400px"
    class="z-depth-1"
    autoplay=true
    muted=true
    loop=true
%}

As a side note, if you find the default menu text for this skin too casual/unprofessional,
you can change it in `./bin/skins/ExperimentalGear/scripts/language/EN.lua`.

### Heavenly Express

{% include video.liquid 
    path="/assets/img/posts/sdvx/heavenly-express.webm"
    width="400px"
    class="z-depth-1"
    autoplay=true
    muted=true
    loop=true
%}


## Crew
Not all skins come with a cast of crews, like the ExperimentalGear skin which
only comes with a boring empty `nothing` skin in
`./bin/skins/ExperimentalGear/textures/crew/anim`.

As crews are very important for our psychological safety and well-being,
fortunately we can just copy over the animations from other skins.
In HeavenlyExpress, you can find it in `./bin/skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/textures/_shared/crew`. Similarly, in LiqidWave they are stored in `./bin/skins/LiqidWave-1.5.0/textures/_shared/crew`.

{% include video.liquid 
    path="/assets/img/posts/sdvx/rasis.webm"
    width="400px"
    class="z-depth-1"
    autoplay=true
    muted=true
    loop=true
%}

## Conclusion
If you've made it this far, congrats and thanks for reading!  I hope you'll
enjoy the game as much as I do.  If you have any questions or run into problems,
feel free to ask in the comments section below.

## Extras

### Aside: KSM Chart Formats
KSM charts have a `.ksh` extensions. This can be a useful check to ensure
that any charts that you download are actually for this game.

The following is a snippet of the `ADV.ksh` (i.e advanced beatmap)
file for YOASOBI's Idol (アイドル):

## Possible Errors And How To Resolve
Some errors I faced when trying to setup and configure the game.

### module `commonShared` not found

If you get a Lua error about not being able to load a `commonShared` package,
such as when using a custom skin:

```bash
[14:45:10][Error] Lua error: ...clone/bin/skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/scripts/common.lua:2: module 'commonShared' not found:
	no field package.preload['commonShared']
	no file '/usr/local/share/lua/5.3/commonShared.lua'
	no file '/usr/local/share/lua/5.3/commonShared/init.lua'
	no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.3/commonShared.lua'
	no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.3/commonShared/init.lua'
	no file './commonShared.lua'
	no file './commonShared/init.lua'
	no file '/Users/fanpu/unnamed-sdvx-clone/bin/skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/scripts/commonShared.lua'
	no file 'skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/textures/_shared/scripts/commonShared.lua'
	no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.3/commonShared.so'
	no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.3/loadall.so'
	no file './commonShared.so'

```

You are likely running the game from the root of the project directory (i.e
`./bin/usc-game`), instead of from within the `./bin` directory itself.

### HeavenlyExpress Skin: Could not load shaders

If you are using the HeavenlyExpress skin, you may run into the following
error after selecting a track to play:

```bash
Shader Error: 
Could not load shaders skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/shaders/holdbutton.vs 
and skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/shaders/holdbutton.fs
```

You may also get logs like this:

```bash
[14:58:37][Error] Shader program compile log for /Users/fanpu/unnamed-sdvx-clone/bin/skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/shaders/holdbutton.vs: ERROR: 0:6: 'varying' : syntax error: syntax error

[14:58:37][Error] Shader program compile log for /Users/fanpu/unnamed-sdvx-clone/bin/skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/shaders/holdbutton.fs: ERROR: 0:10: 'varying' : syntax error: syntax error

[14:58:37][Error] Failed to load vertex shader for material from /Users/fanpu/unnamed-sdvx-clone/bin/skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/shaders/holdbutton.vs
```

The shaders were probably written a long time ago, since
the `varying` keyword has been deprecated since OpenGL 3.3.
It was previously used as a qualifier for variables that communicate
between the vertex shader and the fragment shader, that is now
replaced by the `in` and `out` qualifiers to provide a more clear distinction of
data flow between shaders.

To fix this, modify the two files and change the `varying`
keyword to `out` in both files:

In file `bin/skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/shaders/holdbutton.vs`:
```c
#version 330
#extension GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects : enable
layout(location=0) in vec2 inPos;
layout(location=1) in vec2 inTex;

out vec4 position; // update here

out gl_PerVertex
{
        vec4 gl_Position;
};

...rest of file omitted...
```

In file `bin/skins/HeavenlyExpress-1.3.0/shaders/holdbutton.fs`:
```c
#version 330
#extension GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects : enable

layout(location=1) in vec2 fsTex;
layout(location=0) out vec4 target;

uniform sampler2D mainTex;
uniform float objectGlow;

out vec4 position; // update here

...rest of file omitted...
```

Restart the game and you should be good now.

### ExperimentalGear Custom Skin Does Not Change

I faced issues where it appeared that the value that I set in the settings page
for the skin to use was not being saved. I resolved
this by manually editing the config file in
`./bin/skins/ExperimentalGear/skin.cfg`.
