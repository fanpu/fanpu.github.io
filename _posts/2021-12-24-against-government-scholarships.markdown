since the post was originally written, and to use a more nuanced tone*

Over the past few years, I've received numerous questions about studying abroad
and whether it is advisable to take a government scholarship to do so from my
juniors. Having witnessed firsthand the early career trajectories of many
scholars and non-scholars alike, and having heard their different perspectives,
I feel like I have a good understanding of the concerns at hand to answer
this question confidently. 

This post is aimed at Singaporean junior college students debating
whether they should take on a scholarship from the government to pursue a
fully-paid education abroad. 

In this post, I will consider both the pros and cons of taking a scholarship.
The relevance of some of the points is highly dependent on your current
situation, so ultimately take it with a grain of salt and consider
your unique circumstances.

# Why You Should Take a Scholarship
The three main reasons for taking a scholarship are financial hardship,
choice of major, and the desire to join the civil service as a career.

## Financial Hardship

It is well-known that an overseas college education is expensive and can set you
back by over half a million dollars. Most universities do not offer financial
aid for international students, and so for many families from humble
backgrounds, a scholarship is the only realistic way to pay for their children's
overseas education. 

The opportunity to study abroad provides you with an invaluable global
perspective of your field. It turns you into a small fish in a big ocean,
making you realize both the biases that you had due to your unique
Singaporean background, as well as the biases of the local students and
other international students from other countries.
You will grow and learn alongside many of the smartest people in your
generation, and make lifelong friends and connections.
You will get to listen to lectures from faculty members who were pioneers in
your field.
The experience will develop your independence, broaden your worldview, and is
overall an unforgettable life experience.

If you do not have the means to pay for your studies abroad, a scholarship
opens the door to this transformative experience that will stay with you for a
lifetime.

However, if you decide that this is your main reason (which is true for most
people), ask yourself again whether you or your family are just hesitant to
pay for college due to the sticker shock, or if there is indeed financial
hardship. Many scholars who initially took on a bond due to "financial reasons"
were suddenly able to find the funds to break their bond after securing a
lucrative job or internship offer towards the end of their studies. Investing in
your own future through education is the most worthwhile form of investment that
will pay dividends for the rest of your life, so think hard about whether it is
just a difficult conversation that you are trying to avoid having, or if there
is indeed financial hardship.

## Major
If the career prospects from your choice of major are not significantly more
attractive than working in the public sector, then taking a scholarship is a
reasonable choice. However, there are many caveats to this decision. College is
a time of academic exploration and self-discovery, and you may easily find
yourself switching majors or finding your interests changed. If it so happens
that your new major is in a relatively well-paying sector, then it will make
financial sense for you to break your bond, albeit incurring hefty interest on
the principal paid out by the scholarship so far. Therefore, you should only
consider a scholarship if you are very confident about your commitment to your
intended field of study.

## Desire To Join The Civil Service And Serve The Country
People with a genuine heart to serve the country are few and far between, and I
sincerely applaud you if you fall into this camp. A scholarship in this case
would be the best way to realize your careers and dreams. The goal of
scholarships is to nurture the next generation of leaders to build and run the
country, and people like you who dare to step up and take on the
reins of responsibility are truly admirable.

# Why You Should Not Take A Scholarship
Now we move on to the many reasons that should make you re-consider whether a
scholarship is actually suitable for you. I will apologize in advance
if I accidentally inadvertently offend someone. 

## Societal Expectations, Rite of Passage, Prestige
This is probably the worst reason to consider a scholarship. Unfortunately, the
culture in JCs tends to glamorize and portray scholarship holders as the
pinnacle of academic success and as a model for the rest of the student
population to emulate, such that you are often compelled by those around you to
apply as long as you are in good academic standing. It also does not help that
government boards have very effective and persuasive scholarship outreach
campaigns that start as early as secondary school. It might almost seem like you
are missing out and not optimizing for your future if you don't apply for a
scholarship. The constant scholarship award ceremony photo-ops, newpaper
articles of newly minted scholars, and even posters of role-model alumni
scholars around your school does quite have this effect.

However, you need to cut through this fog of hype surrounding scholarships.
What you won't see at this point is that after you go to college, scholarship
fairs now become career fairs. You will constantly see recruiters from top
companies come to your school to attract top talent with swag and competitive
compensation, and now you will feel like you are missing out on all these
industry opportunities because you already committed to the government.

Furthermore, the prestige factor only holds for a short period of time within a
relatively localized circle. Nobody overseas will care much about the fact that
you are a scholar, and neither will they understand anything about the
"prestige" tiers of the scholarship, or the selectiveness of the agency you are
bonded to. In the US (and similarly in other countries), people will only
recognize established local scholarships such as the [Barry
Goldwater](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/) scholarship for sophomores
actively engaged in research.  Unfortunately, these are not even open to non-U.S.
citizens.

On the other hand, people overseas will be very intrigued and impressed by
your experiences during National Service, and will ask you for many stories
of what you did as it is a relatively uncommon experience there. On a few
occasions, my friends told me they already felt safer knowing they were being
escorted by a military-trained man while we were walking through some sketchy
streets in the US.

## But They Were So Nice To Me
I personally benefited a lot from programs organized by agencies that
offer scholarships. For instance, the DSTA Young Defence Scientists Programme (YDSP)
provided me with opportunities to do research attachments with DSTA and DSO
researchers, and to also gain exposure to topics like cryptography and AI
in their World of Science lecture series program. I also received a lot of swag
from them, like folders and notebooks. I am very grateful to them for all of these
opportunities, which I am sure is doing a great deal to shape the future of
Singapore's technology leaders. However, I know that I am best poised to serve
the world not in DSTA but elsewhere.

Similarly, regardless of how much you benefited from various outreach programmes
by these agencies, keep in mind that at the end of the day this is still your
career and that you are not obliged to join them. If you want to show your gratitude,
think about where you will be best poised to contribute to the future development
of our country and the world, and if the agency is actually still the best place
to do that.

## Complacency and Diminished Drive
This is not something that people think about immediately, but knowing that you
are bonded to a scholarship after graduation for the next 6 years brings about a
lack of agency and diminished accountability for your future. Why bother grinding
so hard if your future career has already been planned by some higher-ups?
This can have the following consequences.

### Fewer Industry Internship Opportunities
This point is slightly less applicable if you have decided you want to work for the
government for the rest of your life, since having more experience across
different government agencies could arguably be more useful than interning
for a company. However, being able to see a different side of how private firms
operate is also very valuable.

In Singapore, scholars have to spend their sophomore summer interning at the
government agency that they are bonded to.  This creates a trend where many
scholars do not bother applying, or do not really try hard to apply for
internships in their freshmen year. Why?  It is extremely difficult to get any
interviews as a freshmen, much less an offer. Furthermore, they know that their
subsequent internship next year has already been secured. As such, it does
not seem to be worth the effort to start worrying about internships so early on.

However, this has grave implications.  This means that by the time that they are
in their junior year, they will be competing against other students who have at
least one or two internships from American companies under their belt, which
for recruiters holds significantly more brand-name recognition than internships from
foreign government agencies. This often affects their ability to get a good
internship in their penultimate year, which is when you are the most attractive
to companies since you will be graduating the following year.

Furthermore, the brand name effect of internships compounds. Most people do
not just suddenly land into some big company on their first try.
Usually, they start by gaining experience at a startup or early-stage unicorn,
before moving on to some bigger publicly-listed companies, and then places like big tech.
Your experience at each place shows that you have been able to deliver value and impact,
which allows you to clear resume screens at increasingly selective companies. 

Having only 1 industry internship experience as a scholar would therefore put you
at a massive resume disadvantage for future opportunities. 

An internship is also one of the most fun things you will get to do during
college. You'll get to work on exciting real-world projects, attend classes and
meetings, go for intern social and team-bonding events, and explore and
experience living in a new city. Almost every full-timer secretly wish
they could be pampered and showered with attention like an intern again. And it
is a real pity if you miss out on these experiences.

### Paradoxically Poorer Academic Standing
Scholars are required to maintain good academic standing, which usually includes
some minimum GPA requirement. This could set an artificially lower bar to shoot
for than what you could have otherwise aimed for. On the flip side, the GPA
requirement can also incentivize taking easier classes to protect your grades at
the expense of growth and learning. It could discourage taking hard classes or
classes which you know almost nothing about when those usually turn out to be
the most transformative experiences that you will go through. 

### An Academic Moral Hazard
During one of the first orientation sessions at CMU, our first-year academic
advisor told us that by amortizing the tuition that we are paying over our
classes, each lecture has an implicit price tag of $200 (probably higher now as
tuition has increased since). The message is pay attention every lecture
and think twice about the true opportunity cost if you want to skip lecture.

As a scholar, the cost of education is no longer borne by you, and the
opportunity cost for other (in particularly leisure) activities have decreased.
It becomes very tempting to decide to spend more of your time traveling around
and to enjoy the good life abroad. There is nothing wrong with that, especially
if it helps with your mental health, but you need to remember that first and foremost
your goal is to obtain a quality education.

## Unrealized Earning Potential
This section is relevant if you intend to work in the tech sector.
I am not very familiar with industry rates for other sectors, and will
refrain from commenting.

According to [this post](https://blog.seedly.sg/civil-service-salary/),
the starting salary for civil servants will be around 4-5.5k SGD in base pay,
and 1-3 months in bonuses. While GovTech does a bit better as they try
to peg their compensation to baseline industry levels.,
you really want to be positioned at a company that is the market leader in
setting salaries instead.

If you are going to be based in the US, you can expect to get around 200k USD
annual pre-tax total compensation if you land an entry-level role at
fast-growing unicorns or big tech companies like FAANG. 
If you can rise to become one of the best among your batch, you can expect
double that amount at more selective firms. Check out
[levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) if you want more specific data. 

In industry, you will be leveled every few years with generous pay bumps, and
you should become a senior engineer by your sixth year (most people should be
there by their fourth year). In contrast, if you took a scholarship you have
only just completed your bond, and depending on your specific agency, you may
not have gained a lot of relevant industry experience if your future plan is to
return to industry.

As such, after six years in industry, not only will you be able to
pay off your student loans, but you will also have the opportunity to work with and
learn from the best and brightest in the world, gain a lot of relevant
experience and exposure, make a lot of valuable professional connections, and
have a secure financial base from which you can decide your next career step. In
tech, six years is a long time. People stay for only two to three years on
average at a company, so you may have already worked at two or three companies
by the time you are done.

On the other hand, if you take on a scholarship, you will almost be in your
thirties by the time you are done with your bond. It can be challenging to make
headway into the industry now if your prior job experiences and taskings are not
relevant, which may be something that is out of your control.  It is also a
problem if your agency is in a sensitive area like defense because you cannot
share about the work that you have done. There are also a lot of "bad habits"
that you may pick up from bureaucratic government agencies which can cause
companies to believe that you are not a good cultural fit and overlook your
candidacy. Finally, I don't mean to sound ageist, but when you are in your
thirties with no industry experience on your belt and you are competing against
much younger and hungrier fresh college graduates for jobs, the odds are not
really in your favor. This fact may encourage scholars to continue staying in
their jobs out of fear of competition, and before you know it, you've spent your
entire career there.

## Blocked from Achieving Your Fullest Potential
You want the option to go to where your work matters most and where you can make
the most impact. You want to be in an environment where you can constantly grow
and be challenged. You never want to be the smartest person in the room. If you
are in the private sector, you can always easily resign or switch teams if the
environment is not conducive for your career goals. The same cannot be said when
you are bonded to an agency, where institutional delineations and red tape
means you are very much resigned to your fate. From an economic standpoint,
this can be seen as a form of market inefficiency. A scholarship
could thus prevent you from doing all the great things that you could otherwise
achieved.

Imagine graduating from college and reaching the peak of your intellectual
development, having been equipped with the knowledge and skills to make a
difference in the world, and then having to spend the next six years at a
bureaucratic job that will most likely not make the best use of your talents,
resulting in intellectual stagnation and perhaps even regression. Your working
environment will likely not be anywhere as stimulating and challenging. Instead
of solving hard problems, you will be playing office politics and counting down
the days before you are eligible for the next promotion. There is an implicit
glass ceiling and pre-determined career progression rate depending on which
scholarship you held. When one feels like they can no longer make an impact
and influence their trajectories, quiet quitting begins. Is this
really the best way to start a career?

## A Big Life Decision You Are Probably Not Ready To Make Yet
The prefrontal cortex, which is the area of our brain in charge of planning and
making important life decisions, does not mature fully until we are 25. 
From a psychological perspective, it is perhaps unwise to be committing
at such an early age what you are going to do for the next 10 years of your
life. Most people are not so lucky to have figured out who they are and what
they want to do by then. 
It is much better to keep your options open and know that you are limited only
by how big you dream.

# Concluding Remarks
There are good reasons on both sides on whether you should take a scholarship.
My goal is not to discourage people from considering them, but to provide a
fuller picture of what happens down the road if you decide to go down either
path. My wish is for this post to help improve the overall efficiency of the
scholarship system, by encouraging people who have legitimate reasons for a
scholarship to have confidence in their decision to pursue them, and for those
who are uncertain to think about it again. This helps to alleviate the rampant
problem of scholars breaking their bonds, which not only is unfair for those who
needed them and were denied the opportunity, but also wastes time and money for
both them and the government.

Remember, a scholarship is not free. When you take a scholarship,
you give up your own freedom and the ability to chart your own future.
