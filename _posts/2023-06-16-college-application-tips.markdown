Disclaimers: Admittedly most of these will be advice will be on "negatives" -
on myths, things that are not true, things that you should avoid falling prey to.
It is natural that you demand that I also provide some "positives", in terms of 
what I should do, and things that will work.
But given the complexity, subjectivity, and nuances
of the college admission system, it is difficult, and perhaps
even desirable, that such a template does not exist.
The whole beauty (or horror) of the system is its subjectivity.

I am generally very hesitant to say what works due to survivorship bias.
One could point to a failed college application and identify a hundred reasons why
the applicant was rejected, but then can you look at a successful college
application and definitively say that there were some critical deciding factors?


# Some (Probably) Good Advice
- probably already repeated a bunch of times by your school college admission counsellors, but here for completeness

## Making Use of Opportunities
Due to the large diversity in applicant backgrounds (and in particular for
international applicants), admission counselors will consider your application in
the context of your specific background.

To tell whether you will be successful at their college, they
want to see if you made the best use of the opportunities available to you.
This means that even if you came from a less-fortunate background,
you don't have to be discouraged and feel like you do not
have a competitive edge if you played the cards that you were dealt with well.
Indeed, your resourcefulness can be a strength.

## Not Where You Start, But Where You Finish
It really does not matter all that much where
you start in college. 4 years of college is a long time, and whatever headstart
some people may have will be quickly eroded over the years. 

So instead of thinking:
> How do I show that I am well-prepared for college?

think

> How do I show that I will be successful in college and life,
> and they will be proud to have me as an alumni?

## Your Unique Contribution
What's unique about you? Think about your values, experiences, and beliefs.  I
once heard someone say that deciding which students to admit is like figuring
out a large jigsaw puzzle. What's your unique contribution that makes
you a good fit for completing the puzzle?

## Figure Out If The School Is A Good Fit For You

## Intellectual Humility

## Your Personal Voice

## Your Story

# Worries
Crafting your application is hard and there's many worries
you might hold about your application. But it can also be
a very rewarding journey. In this part I hope to address some common
concerns.

## But There's Nothing Special About Me
> How do I stand out?

This is the most common question that prospective students would ask. A
surface-level reading of this question seems to suggest achievements and awards.


However, given the competitive application landscape and
the emphasis on student body diversity, your greatest strength
is actually your 

 and the scary and beautiful
thing is only you can answer this question.

As a 17 or 18-year-old, you just experienced a lot of change and growth
over your teenage years. You've been deluged with a flood of 'whats'
and 'hows', but rarely 'why'.
It is a time when you explore your interests and try
to understand yourself better. 

Understanding yourself and finding your identity takes time and effort.
Self-reflection and personal understanding is a long and scary process, but
college applications present the perfect excuse for you to embark on this
journey now. Many people never really know who they are or what they want until
late in life, if ever!

Look back on your life experiences, and major events that shaped you
as a person. What kind of choices did you make, and why? Are there
some recurring themes that you can identify? What kind of future
do you envision for yourself?

Ultimately do this 

- good chance to do it now! not just for your college app, but for yourself. once you find out what you
love and want to do, you will have a north star guiding your every decision, and
everything else will fall into place

## Can I Get Into School ABC If I Don't Have XYZ?

# Myths
In this section, I dispel some of the commonly-held myths about college applications.

## The Exceptional Talent Myth
It is a misconception that you need to be some sort of genius to be admitted to
any of the top schools.

At [CMU SCS](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), one of the things that our academic
advisor told us during orientation was that when they admitted students,
they made sure that:

- 1/3 of the students had significant programming experience,
- 1/3 of the students had some exposure to programming (i.e took AP CS),
- 1/3 of the students had no programming experience.

This is important, because you don't just want a homogeneous crowd of IOI and
IMO medallists who all have the same interests, which would make for a very
poor undergraduate experience. You want people from different backgrounds
and passions, all with their unique role to play to enrich the student body.

## The Portfolio Myth
Common question: how do I stand out? how do I improve my portfolio?

- was part of a hiring committee
- shared by Dave
- "many people are good, and would be successful whereever they go.
but good is not enough. you want someone
who impresses you so much that you know you must get them"
- doing things for the sake of it is unlikely to change this aspect of you
- find some part about you that is unique to yourself
- it's all so tiring and fake

Well, how did you think you stood out?
- genuine passion for something?

## The Good Grades Myth
> I got 15XX for my SAT, do I need to retake it? 


## The SAT Score Myth
> I got 15XX for my SAT, do I need to retake it? 

Treat SAT scores as just a baseline.  A poor SAT score would be a red flag, but
a perfect SAT score does not really add much to your application. If you already
have an ok SAT score, it would probably be a better use of your time to focus on
other parts of your application.

# Dont's

## Rehashing your Resume 

## Negativity

## Portfolio Chasing

# Is It Worth It?

## Should I Take A Scholarship?

## Expected Value

# Strange But Reasonable Questions

## Backdoor Majors
> School A is very good at X. Should I apply to a
> less competitive major Y and then try to transfer to X?

My personal view is that you should be upfront
with what you really want. If you are a good fit
for the program and can demonstrate it, there's
a good chance that the school will think the same.

When I applied to CMU, I could rank 3 colleges
within CMU that I wanted my application to be considered for. This was my preference list:

1. School of Computer Science
2. N.A.
3. N.A.

That said, it is common to be unsure of what you want to do in college yet, and
it is reasonable to consider the possibility of
changing programs.

If you wish to do so, you should first do your own homework on whether
transferring to a specific major after admission is even possible at the school
that you are interested in, as not all of them allow this.

The other thing to consider is how your academic progress will be affected.
For example, at CMU the high interest
in introductory CS classes makes it difficult
for non-CS majors to get into these classes
due to a lack of seats for non-majors.

In addition, you must continue taking classes for
your original major before your transfer request
is approved, which usually only happens beyond
the second or third year. This means that you
may have to graduate late to complete all requirements for your new major, or end up
graduating with fewer classes and expertise in
your new major.

## I Heard It Is Easier for People X To Get Into Program Y
- missing the point: not really because of the attribute of X, but
because of the lived experiences of people with attribute X

## Dealing with Rejection

TODO fanpu: maybe defer this to a future post

# The Bigger Picture
With all that is said, let's take a step
back and look at the bigger picture
of what college applications are all about,
and the spirit that you should carry.

## Firstly, Do It For Yourself
The results of your college applications are not guaranteed. You could have a fantastic application
and still be rejected, and vice versa.

What is guaranteed is that the new insights that you will gain of yourself
during this journey of self-reflection
will stay with you for the rest of your life.
This is a really precious opportunity for doing so.
*Do it for yourself!*


## Have A Bit Of Fun
- doesn't have to all be so serious, make it fun, add some humor in appropriate places

## You Can Be Successful Anywhere

- own story on getting rejected from stanford, feeling sadge

## Sometimes It Is Better To Not Achieve What You Want
> And even though I did not reach the NFL, I sometimes think I got more from
> persuing that dream, and not accomplishing it, then I did from many of the ones
> I did accomplish.

## Rejection Does Not Define Who You Are
add some quote maybe

don't let a bunch people halfway across the world tell you what you can or cannot do with your life

college, so what?
good job, so what?
good life, so what?
can you not have a good life by being satisfied with less?
