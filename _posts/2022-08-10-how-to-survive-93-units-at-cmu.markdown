Senior spring is a time of opportunity.  You would have cleared most of your
required courses, and can take whatever that fancies you. Some opt to drop to
being a part-time student and spend the extra time on extra-curriculars or to
develop their own interests. Some decide to graduate a semester early entirely.
Some yet still decide that since it is the last semester of their undergraduate
career, GPA no longer has any material effect on their outcomes (usually people
would already have job offers or graduate school admissions lined up before
graduation), and so what better way to take advantage of it than to take all the
classes that interests you relatively stress-free? And that was actually precisely 
what I decided to do.

### Motivation

I ended up registering for the following classes, with the blessings of my
advisor [Mark Stehlik](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjs/), who is probably one of the
most supportive and caring people at CMU that I know:

- 15-751 **[A Theorist's
Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3J0oaFux3ZYpFLwwrlv_EHH9wtH6pnX)** (12 units)

- 10-725 **Convex Optimization** (12 units)

- 15-312 **Foundations of Programming Languages** (12 units)

- 15-819 **Advanced Topics in Programming Language Theory** (12 units)

- 16-385 **[Computer Vision](http://16385.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2022/)** (12 units)

- 21-355 **Principles of Real Analysis I** (9 units)

- 21-484 **Graph Theory** (9 units)

- 70-350 **Acting for Business** (9 units)

- 18-358 **[Introduction to Amateur Radio](https://tomzajdel.com/ece358/)** (6 units)

On top of that, I'm on the Autolab team where we have 2 meetings per week (one
general meeting and one hacking session for the devs to have a common time to
work together), and a ~12 hour/week expected commitment.

### Initial problems

There were of course some hurdles I had to get through. 

First, 15-819 (*Advanced Topics in Programming Language Theory*) technically had
15-312 (*Foundations of Programming Languages*) as a pre-req, but I managed to
convince the instructor Bob Harper to let me into the class by taking it
concurrently. I also previously took and then dropped 15-312 halfway through in
my junior year, so it wasn't entirely unreasonable.

Second, 16-385 (*Computer Vision*) conflicted with the recitation for 15-312.  I
ended up getting permission from the instructor of 15-312 Jan Hoffmann to be
allowed to skip recitation in exchange for reading the recitation notes after
they are posted. It will actually turn out that this won't be strictly necessary.

### A Day in the Life
The calendar below outlines what a normal week looks like.

![What my weekly calendar looks like](/assets/images/posts/cmu_week_calendar.png){: width="100%"}

Here's what my routine looks like.

#### Monday
- 9.30am: Wake up, oversleep my alarm slightly, go for Graph Theory, usually
arrive at class ~5 minutes late and lose some context about what the professor
is presenting but try to piece it quickly afterwards.
- 11.00am: Go to either Sorrells Library, Tepper Quad, Gates, or the Autolab room to work on homework. Skip Make an mobile order for food for Rose Tea Cafe. 

#### Tuesday


#### Wednesday

From my experience with CS and math classes at CMU (and I'm pretty sure this is
applicable to any other place as well), you cannot afford to fall behind,
because once you do it becomes a snowball effect where lectures become
increasingly less useful as you lose more and more context about what is going
on. Given how 


### What 


#### Skip Some Lectures That Are Recorded

I find it significantly easier to pay attention on classes

This depends on your personal risk tolerance, but there are some lectures 



#### Think about a problem before you sleep


#### Soylent

Soylent is a good choice as a substitute for breakfast in the morning. You only have to grab it from the fridge each morning and begin chugging it.

Not only does it mean that you don't have to make breakfast and 

To get more shut-eye in the morning,
