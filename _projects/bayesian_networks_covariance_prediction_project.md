title: Graphical Bayesian Networks for Predicting Asset Covariances
description: >
  Covariance matrix prediction is a long-standing challenge in modern portfolio
  theory and quantitative finance. In this project, we investigate the
  effectiveness of Bayesian networks in predicting the covariance matrix of
  financial assets (specifically a subset of the S&P 500), evaluated against
  Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) models.
