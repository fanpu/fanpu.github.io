title: "Pseudo-determinism for Graph Streaming Problems"
description: >
   Given a fixed input for a search problem, pseudo-deterministic algorithms
   produce the same answer over multiple independent runs, with high probability.
   For example, we can efficiently find a certificate for inequality of
   multivariate polynomials pseudo-deterministically, but it is not known how to
   do so deterministically. The same notion can be extended to the streaming
   model. The problem of finding a nonzero element from a turnstile stream is
   previously shown to require linear space for both deterministic and
   pseudo-deterministic algorithms. Another model of streaming problems is that
   of graphs, where edge insertions and deletions occur along a stream. Some
   natural problems include connectivity, bipartiteness, and colorability of a
   graph. While the randomized and deterministic graph streaming algorithms
   have been mostly well-studied, we investigate pseudo-deterministic space
   lower bounds and upper bounds for graph theoretic streaming problems.
