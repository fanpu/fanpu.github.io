title: Analysis of Symmetry and Conventions in Off-Belief Learning in Hanabi
description: >
  Hanabi has been proposed as the new frontier for developing strategies in
  cooperative AI, currently a very nascent area of AI research. A recent
  algorithm that has been developed for multi-agent reinforcement learning in a
  cooperative context is the Off-Belief Learning (OBL) algorithm, which is
  based on iterated reasoning starting from a base policy. We investigate if
  policies learnt by agents using the OBL algorithm in the multi-player
  cooperative game Hanabi in the zero-shot coordination (ZSC) context are
  invariant across symmetries of the game, and if any conventions formed during
  training are arbitrary or natural, both of which are desirable properties.
