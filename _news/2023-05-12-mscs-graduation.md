Today, I received my Master of Science in Computer Science
degree from Carnegie Mellon's [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/)
after two additional semesters of study.
I would like to thank my friends
and family for their unwavering love and
encouragement, my many fantastic professors for showing me how beautiful their
intellectual gardens are and for guiding me through them, the [Autolab
team](https://autolabproject.com/) for their excellence and being a community to
belong to on campus, the [Singapore Student Association
(SSA)](https://cmussa.org/) for organizing many events to remind me of home and
most notably for pulling off [Spring Carnival
Booth](https://www.springcarnival.org/booth.shtml), and my academic advisor [Dave
Eckhardt](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~davide/) and the Master's Program
Administrator [Angy Malloy](https://csd.cmu.edu/people/staff/angy-malloy) for
helping me resolve and navigate numerous course-related issues.

Choosing to pursue an advanced degree in Computer Science was one of the
best decisions I could have ever made. It offered me the opportunity to study
theoretical machine learning in-depth, and has provided me with
a lot of valuable exposure to research from research-oriented course projects,
and by working alongside PhD students from the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/)
as a teaching assistant for [10-708 Probabilistic Graphical
Models](https://andrejristeski.github.io/10708-S23/).
