I added a new page to curate CMU CS courses that have publicly available
lecture videos and course content, available on the
[CMU Online tab]( {% link _pages/cmu-online.md %} ).
Hope this will be helpful for many people! Feel free to let me know if there are
things that I missed which would be good to add via email.
