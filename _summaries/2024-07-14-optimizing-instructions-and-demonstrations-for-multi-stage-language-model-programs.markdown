### Three Important Things

#### 1. MIPRO

This paper introduces MIPRO (Multi-prompt Instruction PRoposal Optimizer) for
optimizing multi-stage prompts. Multi-stage here means that there is a chain of
LLM calls required to solve the task, usually done so that a complex task is
broken down into simpler sub-tasks.

The paper builds on OPRO (see paper summary
[here]({% link _summaries/2024-07-13-large-language-models-as-optimizers.markdown %})),

#### 2. Bar
