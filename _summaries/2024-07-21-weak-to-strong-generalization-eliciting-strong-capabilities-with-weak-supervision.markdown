### Three Important Things

#### 1. Weak-to-Strong Generalization

The problem of weak-to-strong generalization is how a weak teacher model can
teach a stronger student to perform better than it. 

This is relevant in the context of superalignment, where 
while we have found traditional success in using RLHF to align models
to follow our preferences, such techniques may no longer work when models 
become smarter than us and we are no longer capable of supervising its outputs.

#### 2. Experiments

The paper uses 3 experiments:

#### 3. Baz
