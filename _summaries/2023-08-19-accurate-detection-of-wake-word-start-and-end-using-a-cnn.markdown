### Three Important Things

#### 1. Start-end Regression Model
The authors introduce two types of architectures
for wake word detection. The first is the
start-end regression model, where the input signal 
is passed through several stacked convolution and pooling layers,
before forking off into two different outputs, as illustrated
in the diagram below.

The first output will output the wake word detection,
