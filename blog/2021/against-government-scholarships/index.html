      <p><em>This post was updated on 12 June 2023 to include some new perspectives Iâve had
since the post was originally written, and to use a more nuanced tone</em></p>

<p>Over the past few years, Iâve received numerous questions about studying abroad
and whether it is advisable to take a government scholarship to do so from my
juniors. Having witnessed firsthand the early career trajectories of many
scholars and non-scholars alike, and having heard their different perspectives,
I feel like I have a good understanding of the concerns at hand to answer
this question confidently.</p>

<p>This post is aimed at Singaporean junior college students debating
whether they should take on a scholarship from the government to pursue a
fully-paid education abroad.</p>

<p>In this post, I will consider both the pros and cons of taking a scholarship.
The relevance of some of the points is highly dependent on your current
situation, so ultimately take it with a grain of salt and consider
your unique circumstances.</p>

<h1 id="why-you-should-take-a-scholarship">Why You Should Take a Scholarship</h1>
<p>The three main reasons for taking a scholarship are financial hardship,
choice of major, and the desire to join the civil service as a career.</p>

<h2 id="financial-hardship">Financial Hardship</h2>

<p>It is well-known that an overseas college education is expensive and can set you
back by over half a million dollars. Most universities do not offer financial
aid for international students, and so for many families from humble
backgrounds, a scholarship is the only realistic way to pay for their childrenâs
overseas education.</p>

<p>The opportunity to study abroad provides you with an invaluable global
perspective of your field. It turns you into a small fish in a big ocean,
making you realize both the biases that you had due to your unique
Singaporean background, as well as the biases of the local students and
other international students from other countries.
You will grow and learn alongside many of the smartest people in your
generation, and make lifelong friends and connections.
You will get to listen to lectures from faculty members who were pioneers in
your field.
The experience will develop your independence, broaden your worldview, and is
overall an unforgettable life experience.</p>

<p>If you do not have the means to pay for your studies abroad, a scholarship
opens the door to this transformative experience that will stay with you for a
lifetime.</p>

<p>However, if you decide that this is your main reason (which is true for most
people), ask yourself again whether you or your family are just hesitant to
pay for college due to the sticker shock, or if there is indeed financial
hardship. Many scholars who initially took on a bond due to âfinancial reasonsâ
were suddenly able to find the funds to break their bond after securing a
lucrative job or internship offer towards the end of their studies. Investing in
your own future through education is the most worthwhile form of investment that
will pay dividends for the rest of your life, so think hard about whether it is
just a difficult conversation that you are trying to avoid having, or if there
is indeed financial hardship.</p>

<h2 id="major">Major</h2>
<p>If the career prospects from your choice of major are not significantly more
attractive than working in the public sector, then taking a scholarship is a
reasonable choice. However, there are many caveats to this decision. College is
a time of academic exploration and self-discovery, and you may easily find
yourself switching majors or finding your interests changed. If it so happens
that your new major is in a relatively well-paying sector, then it will make
financial sense for you to break your bond, albeit incurring hefty interest on
the principal paid out by the scholarship so far. Therefore, you should only
consider a scholarship if you are very confident about your commitment to your
intended field of study.</p>

<h2 id="desire-to-join-the-civil-service-and-serve-the-country">Desire To Join The Civil Service And Serve The Country</h2>
<p>People with a genuine heart to serve the country are few and far between, and I
sincerely applaud you if you fall into this camp. A scholarship in this case
would be the best way to realize your careers and dreams. The goal of
scholarships is to nurture the next generation of leaders to build and run the
country, and people like you who dare to step up and take on the
reins of responsibility are truly admirable.</p>

<h1 id="why-you-should-not-take-a-scholarship">Why You Should Not Take A Scholarship</h1>
<p>Now we move on to the many reasons that should make you re-consider whether a
scholarship is actually suitable for you. I will apologize in advance
if I accidentally inadvertently offend someone.</p>

<h2 id="societal-expectations-rite-of-passage-prestige">Societal Expectations, Rite of Passage, Prestige</h2>
<p>This is probably the worst reason to consider a scholarship. Unfortunately, the
culture in JCs tends to glamorize and portray scholarship holders as the
pinnacle of academic success and as a model for the rest of the student
population to emulate, such that you are often compelled by those around you to
apply as long as you are in good academic standing. It also does not help that
government boards have very effective and persuasive scholarship outreach
campaigns that start as early as secondary school. It might almost seem like you
are missing out and not optimizing for your future if you donât apply for a
scholarship. The constant scholarship award ceremony photo-ops, newpaper
articles of newly minted scholars, and even posters of role-model alumni
scholars around your school does quite have this effect.</p>

<p>However, you need to cut through this fog of hype surrounding scholarships.
What you wonât see at this point is that after you go to college, scholarship
fairs now become career fairs. You will constantly see recruiters from top
companies come to your school to attract top talent with swag and competitive
compensation, and now you will feel like you are missing out on all these
industry opportunities because you already committed to the government.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the prestige factor only holds for a short period of time within a
relatively localized circle. Nobody overseas will care much about the fact that
you are a scholar, and neither will they understand anything about the
âprestigeâ tiers of the scholarship, or the selectiveness of the agency you are
bonded to. In the US (and similarly in other countries), people will only
recognize established local scholarships such as the <a href="https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Barry
Goldwater</a> scholarship for sophomores
actively engaged in research.  Unfortunately, these are not even open to non-U.S.
citizens.</p>

<p>On the other hand, people overseas will be very intrigued and impressed by
your experiences during National Service, and will ask you for many stories
of what you did as it is a relatively uncommon experience there. On a few
occasions, my friends told me they already felt safer knowing they were being
escorted by a military-trained man while we were walking through some sketchy
streets in the US.</p>

<h2 id="complacency-and-diminished-drive">Complacency and Diminished Drive</h2>
<p>This is not something that people think about immediately, but knowing that you
are bonded to a scholarship after graduation for the next 6 years brings about a
lack of agency and diminished accountability for your future. Why bother grinding
so hard if your future career has already been planned by some higher-ups?
This can have the following consequences.</p>

<h3 id="fewer-industry-internship-opportunities">Fewer Industry Internship Opportunities</h3>
<p>This point is slightly less applicable if you have decided you want to work for the
government for the rest of your life, since having more experience across
different government agencies could arguably be more useful than interning
for a company. However, being able to see a different side of how private firms
operate is also very valuable.</p>

<p>In Singapore, scholars have to spend their sophomore summer interning at the
government agency that they are bonded to.  This creates a trend where many
scholars do not bother applying, or do not really try hard to apply for
internships in their freshmen year. Why?  It is extremely difficult to get any
interviews as a freshmen, much less an offer. Furthermore, they know that their
subsequent internship next year has already been secured. As such, it does
not seem to be worth the effort to start worrying about internships so early on.</p>

<p>However, this has grave implications.  This means that by the time that they are
in their junior year, they will be competing against other students who have at
least one or two internships from American companies under their belt, which
for recruiters holds significantly more brand-name recognition than internships from
foreign government agencies. This often affects their ability to get a good
internship in their penultimate year, which is when you are the most attractive
to companies since you will be graduating the following year.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the brand name effect of internships compounds. Most people do
not just suddenly land into some big company on their first try.
Usually, they start by gaining experience at a startup or early-stage unicorn,
before moving on to some bigger publicly-listed companies, and then places like big tech.
Your experience at each place shows that you have been able to deliver value and impact,
which allows you to clear resume screens at increasingly selective companies.</p>

<p>Having only 1 industry internship experience as a scholar would therefore put you
at a massive resume disadvantage for future opportunities.</p>

<p>An internship is also one of the most fun things you will get to do during
college. Youâll get to work on exciting real-world projects, attend classes and
meetings, go for intern social and team-bonding events, and explore and
experience living in a new city. Almost every full-timer secretly wish
they could be pampered and showered with attention like an intern again. And it
is a real pity if you miss out on these experiences.</p>

<h3 id="paradoxically-poorer-academic-standing">Paradoxically Poorer Academic Standing</h3>
<p>Scholars are required to maintain good academic standing, which usually includes
some minimum GPA requirement. This could set an artificially lower bar to shoot
for than what you could have otherwise aimed for. On the flip side, the GPA
requirement can also incentivize taking easier classes to protect your grades at
the expense of growth and learning. It could discourage taking hard classes or
classes which you know almost nothing about when those usually turn out to be
the most transformative experiences that you will go through.</p>

<h3 id="an-academic-moral-hazard">An Academic Moral Hazard</h3>
<p>During one of the first orientation sessions at CMU, our first-year academic
advisor told us that by amortizing the tuition that we are paying over our
classes, each lecture has an implicit price tag of $200 (probably higher now as
tuition has increased since). The message is pay attention every lecture
and think twice about the true opportunity cost if you want to skip lecture.</p>

<p>As a scholar, the cost of education is no longer borne by you, and the
opportunity cost for other (in particularly leisure) activities have decreased.
It becomes very tempting to decide to spend more of your time traveling around
and to enjoy the good life abroad. There is nothing wrong with that, especially
if it helps with your mental health, but you need to remember that first and foremost
your goal is to obtain a quality education.</p>

<h2 id="unrealized-earning-potential">Unrealized Earning Potential</h2>
<p>This section is biased towards tech. I donât know the exact
numbers of how much government agencies are paying, but itâs going to pale in
comparison to the private sector overseas. GovTech does a bit better as they try
to peg their compensation to industry levels, although you really want to be
positioned at a company that is the market leader in setting salaries instead.</p>

<p>If you are studying in the US, you can expect to get at least USD 150k annual
total compensation pre-tax if you manage to land an entry-level role at most
fast-growing unicorns or FAANG companies. If you can rise to become one of the
best among your batch, you can expect double that amount. Check out
<a href="https://levels.fyi" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">levels.fyi</a> if you want more specific data.</p>

<p>You will be leveled every few years with generous pay bumps, and you should
become a senior engineer by your sixth year (most people should be there by
their fourth year).  In contrast, if you took a scholarship you have only just
completed your bond, and depending on your specific agency, you may not have
gained a lot of relevant industry experience if your future plan is to return
to industry.</p>

<p>As such, with six years of industry work, not only will you have no problems
paying off student loans, you will have the opportunity to work with and learn
from the best and brightest in the world, gain a lot of relevant experience and
exposure, make a lot of valuable professional connections, and have a secure
financial base from which you can decide your next career step. In tech, six
years is a long time. People stay for only two to three years on average at a
company, so you may have already worked at two or three companies by the time
you are done.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you take on a scholarship, you will almost be in your
thirties by the time you are done with your bond. It can be challenging to make
headway into the industry now if your prior job experiences and taskings are not
relevant, which may be something that is out of your control.  It is also a
problem if your agency is in a sensitive area like defense because you cannot
share about the work that you have done. There are also a lot of âbad habitsâ
that you may pick up from bureaucratic government agencies (if you know you
know), which can cause companies to believe that you are not a good cultural fit
and overlook your candidacy. Finally, I donât mean to sound ageist, but when you
are in your thirties with no industry experience on your belt and you are
competing against much younger and hungrier fresh college graduates for jobs,
the odds are not really in your favor. This fact may encourage scholars to
continue staying in their jobs out of fear of competition, and before you know
it, youâve spent your entire career there.</p>

<h2 id="blocked-from-achieving-your-fullest-potential">Blocked from Achieving Your Fullest Potential</h2>
<p>You want the option to go to where your work matters most and where you can make
the most impact. You want to be in an environment where you can constantly grow
and be challenged. You never want to be the smartest person in the room. If you
are in the private sector, you can always easily resign or switch teams if the
environment is not conducive for your career goals. The same cannot be said when
you are bonded to an agency, where institutional delineations and red tape
means you are very much resigned to your fate. From an economic standpoint,
this can be seen as a form of market inefficiency. A scholarship
could thus prevent you from doing all the great things that you could otherwise
achieved.</p>

<h2 id="a-big-life-decision-you-are-probably-not-ready-to-make-yet">A Big Life Decision You Are Probably Not Ready To Make Yet</h2>
<p>The prefrontal cortex, which is the area of our brain in charge of planning and
making important life decisions, does not mature fully until we are 25. 
From a psychological perspective, it is perhaps unwise to be committing
at such an early age what you are going to do for the next 10 years of your
life. Most people are not so lucky to have figured out who they are and what
they want to do by then. 
It is much better to keep your options open and know that you are limited only
by your own volition.</p>

<h1 id="final-remarks">Final Remarks</h1>
<p>There are good reasons on both sides on whether you should take a scholarship.
My goal is not to discourage people from considering them, but to provide a
fuller picture of what happens down the road if you decide to go down either
path. My wish is for this post to help improve the overall efficiency of the
scholarship system, by encouraging people who have legitimate reasons for a
scholarship to have confidence in their decision to pursue them, and for those
who are uncertain to think about it again. This helps to alleviate the rampant
problem of scholars breaking their bonds, which not only is unfair for those who
needed them and were denied the opportunity, but also wastes time and money for
both them and the government.</p>
