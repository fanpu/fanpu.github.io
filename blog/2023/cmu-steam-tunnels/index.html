The week after course finals concluded, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/slice/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CMU SLICE</a> (Student Leadership, Involvement, and Civic Engagement) organized an Underground Steam Tunnels Tour as a Senior Week event. I was technically not a senior as I am a graduate student, but they were nice enough to let me join.</p> <p>Before I continue, let me warn readers that you are not allowed to enter the steam tunnels by yourself. Please sign up for an official tour by SLICE that will be led by a facilities engineer. From <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/community-policies/steam-tunnels.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Word Student Handbook</a>:</p> <blockquote class="block-danger"> <h4 id="steam-tunnels">Steam Tunnels</h4> <p>Because of the danger to all who enter them, the steam tunnels are locked and anyone found in the tunnels will be subject to serious disciplinary action and/or criminal action. The University Police are responsible for keeping the tunnels locked and apprehending anyone who trespasses in them.</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="the-steam-tunnels">The Steam Tunnels</h1> <p>We met at the fence, and all of us had to sign a waiver and don a helmet (the same white helmet that was used by builders during Spring Carnival booth).</p> <p>We proceeded to the basement of Margaret Morrison Hall, and the engineer guiding the expedition shared some history about how the Margaret Morrison basement was enhanced to be flood-resistant after a flooding incident a few decades ago caused water to also flood into the steam tunnels.</p> <p>We were warned that the tunnels will be hot and claustrophobic, that we should not touch any pipes as they will be extremely hot, and to not poke at any asbestos for obvious reasons. He then unlocked an unmarked door, and let us into the tunnels proper:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/main_tunnel.webp-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/main_tunnel.webp-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/main_tunnel.webp-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/main_tunnel.webp" class="z-depth-1" width="400px" height="auto" style="object-fit: cover" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"> Inside the steam tunnel! </figcaption> </figure> <p>It was initially still quite cool near the door, but the temperature began rising as we went further in. Some sections of the pipes were hissing and you could really feel the warmth emanating from them. At some point I was slightly afraid that a pipe beside me might burst.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/phone_box.webp-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/phone_box.webp-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/phone_box.webp-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/phone_box.webp" class="z-depth-1" width="400px" height="auto" style="object-fit: cover" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"> A phone box in the tunnel. Hopefully no one ever had to use it. </figcaption> </figure> <p>At some point, there was a fork where the tunnel on the left fork became very short and narrow.

It was known as the CFA cavern as it is located right under the steps of CFA:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/cfa_cavern.webp-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/cfa_cavern.webp-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/cfa_cavern.webp-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/cfa_cavern.webp" class="z-depth-1" width="400px" height="auto" style="object-fit: cover" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"> The CFA cavern, with flash photography </figcaption> </figure> <p>Apparently at some point in the past, a very resourceful CFA student decided to make this their home. Not only was rent cheap (free!), but it was also very close to the CFA building! However, they were found by campus police and booted out.</p> <p>I would not say that it was the most ideal living arrangement. There were plastic bottles strewn everywhere, and stalactites growing down from the ceiling. The air was very damp and musty, and would probably do something bad to your lungs if you stayed in there long enough. It was surprisingly much cooler than the steam tunnels right below it though.</p> <p>We then went back down into the tunnels, and continued on:</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/another_tunnel.webp-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/another_tunnel.webp-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/another_tunnel.webp-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/cmu_steam_tunnels/another_tunnel.webp" class="z-depth-1" width="400px" height="auto" style="object-fit: cover" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption"> More tunnels! </figcaption> </figure> <p>As it got close to the end of the tunnels, we were each handed chalk that can be used for leaving our mark in the tunnel.

We took the freight elevator from the corner of Wean to floor PH (penthouse?), AKA Wean 9.</p> <p>Wean 9 was essentially a huge storeroom for CMU FMS (Facility Management Services). There were all sorts of supplies and tools, and even spare doors for classrooms.
