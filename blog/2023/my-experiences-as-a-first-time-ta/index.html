Unfortunately, I was not selected to be one of the TAs, which was somewhat discouraging but also understandable as I did not have any prior TA experience and was still quite early in my academic career (all the other TAs selected were seniors/graduate students) and I gave up on the idea of TA-ing for a while.</p> <p>After that, I gradually developed an interest in computer science theory, and I seriously considered the idea of being a TA 15-455 Undergraduate Complexity Theory during my senior year. I wanted to do it under professor Ryan OâDonnell, who was by far my favorite CS theory professor, but he was not the instructor for the class for any of the semesters, and that plus my intended course load meant I ended up not applying for any TA roles again.</p> <p>In hindsight, I realized that I was really picky in choosing a course to TA. I approached it with the same attitude as if I were going to join a company full-time: I had to really feel passionate about the class and its materials, I had to like my boss (the instructor), I had to feel sufficiently ready to know I could excel in my role and have enough bandwidth for itâ¦ in reality, since it was only a single-semester commitment, it was not really such a make-or-break decision. However, being a TA also does represent a significant opportunity cost in terms of other things that you could be doing on campus, so it should not be taken too lightly as well.</p> <h2 id="being-a-ta-for-10-708"> <a class="anchor" href="#being-a-ta-for-10-708" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Being a TA for 10-708</h2> <p>Halfway through the Fallâ22 semester, I realized that I really enjoyed one of my classes 10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models, to the extent that I get excited when it was Tuesdays or Thursdays because we would have lectures. The course is broadly about the theory of probabilistic graphical models, a framework used for solving a wide spectrum of problems in machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, and so on. Examples include undirected graphical models like Markov Random Fields, directed graphical models like Bayesian networks, variational methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, deep generative models, causality, and so on. The course was rigorous and proof-heavy, drawing on many techniques used in computer science theory, math, and statistics.</p> <p>A few classes after this realization, I summoned up the courage after class to ask the professor if he is looking for any TAs next semester, and that I would be really excited if I could TA for the class. I was not really sure if I am qualified for the role, as prior to this semester I had only taken two other non-intro machine learning classes, and I often felt very out of my depth during lectures. Furthermore, I had no prior TA experience.</p> <p>Andrej was really nice</p> <h2 id="setting-a-new-homework-problem"> <a class="anchor" href="#setting-a-new-homework-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setting a New Homework Problem</h2> <p>I volunteered to set a new homework problem for our second assignment on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Previously, we had a problem that required students to calculate the expected time to move from one node to some other node in a Markov Chain for 3 different graphs, each with varying degrees of âconnectednessâ: a clique, a line graph, and a dumbbell-shaped graph. By computing this expected time, students would be able to get a sense of how long it would take for the Markov Chain to mix, based on the degree of the âconnectednessâ of the graphs. This was important, since one of the key limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods was that it was hard in practice to determine when the Markov Chain has converged to a stationary distribution, and therefore having some intuition about how the properties of the graph would influence that is very helpful.</p> <p>However, this was a relatively tedious problem involving computing many recurrent expectations, and many students who were otherwise technically strong got tripped up when they attempted to take limits of iterating the Markov Chain instead. To make the problem more insightful and to provide a more general result, I set about designing a new problem based on bounding the mixing times of Markov Chains based on the difference between the top two eigenvalues of the graph, i.e the spectral gap.</p> <h2 id="leading-my-first-recitation"> <a class="anchor" href="#leading-my-first-recitation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Leading My First Recitation</h2> <h2 id="some-personal-observations"> <a class="anchor" href="#some-personal-observations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Some Personal Observations</h2> <h3 id="impressive-students"> <a class="anchor" href="#impressive-students" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Impressive Students</h3> <p>The first thing that struck me was how good the students were. There were many students in the class who have significantly more background than me in machine learning. I donât think I ever had any PhD students in machine learning ever come to my office hours, but I definitely had PhD students in other fields that depended on tools from machine learning, as well as a lot of students from the MSML and MCDS programs. Many of them are actively engaged in research, and some of them have even worked as machine learning engineers full-time for several years before enrolling in their programs. They were sharp, and there were a couple of times during office hours where I was immediately corrected when I said something that did not make sense.</p> <p>Given the broad appeal of the class, there were also some students from non-traditional backgrounds that were less prepared. As graduate students are responsible for ensuring that they meet the course requirements themselves since most of them did their undergrad elsewhere, there were some students that did not really have sufficient background and it was difficult to help them in a pedagogically useful manner since the chasm between their current knowledge and what is required was simply too large.</p> <p>I usually hosted one hour of office hours each week, with additional office hours on the week the assignment was due for the assignments that I am in charge of.</p> <h3 id="office-hours-preparation"> <a class="anchor" href="#office-hours-preparation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Office Hours Preparation</h3> <p>Unfortunately I did not really have time to prepare much before my office hours. In contrast, of my friends who were TAs for other classes would work through the entire assignment to familiarize themselves with the problems and to get a sense of the places where students would likely get stuck in order to prepare for their OH.</p> <p>However, it still mostly worked out fine as most of the proof-based problems and programming problems were similar from the previous semester when I took it. Furthermore, as each assignment was released for two weeks, there were usually far fewer students at OH during the first week, meaning I had more time to spend on each student and to regain context on the trickier problems.</p> <p>and so it did not take too much time to regain context, though I still felt apologetic when I had to take a few minutes to think</p> <h3 id="types-of-questions"> <a class="anchor" href="#types-of-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Types of Questions</h3> <p>Almost all the students who came to office hours were there to ask about homework questions. Occasionally, there were also questions about the direction and content of their course projects. This was not too surprising, as it makes sense that they would prefer to go to the professorâs office hours to ask about conceptual questions.</p> <h3 id="grading"> <a class="anchor" href="#grading" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grading</h3> <p>I really enjoyed grading some of the proof-based questions that allowed creativity in how it could be approached.</p> <h3 id="asking"> <a class="anchor" href="#asking" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Asking</h3> <p>When students</p> <h2 id="how-to-be-a-good-student"> <a class="anchor" href="#how-to-be-a-good-student" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How To Be A Good Student</h2> <h3 id="ask"> <a class="anchor" href="#ask" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ask</h3> <p>One large component of the course is a semester-long project that involves doing research in groups related to probabilistic graphical models.</p> <p>The topics that the groups assigned to me chose were very diverse and ranged from novel approaches to multi-agent reinforcement learning as evaluated on StarCraft, to predicting the pathogenicity of protein variants using graphical models.</p> <p>These could be PhD students</p> <p>It felt very much different from wh</p> <p>Students </p> <p>and it was not as stressful or all-consuming as I had worried.</p> <p>which was surprising given that I had been already thinking about doing so for quite a number of semesters, but could not find a class that I felt really passionate about.</p> </article><div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;"> <script>let giscusTheme=localStorage.getItem("theme"),giscusAttributes={src:"https://giscus.app/client.js","data-repo":"fanpu/website","data-repo-id":"R_kgDOIpOodA","data-category":"General","data-category-id":"DIC_kwDOIpOodM4CTKDC","data-mapping":"title","data-strict":"0","data-reactions-enabled":"1","data-emit-metadata":"0","data-input-position":"top","data-theme":giscusTheme,"data-lang":"en",crossorigin:"anonymous",async:""},giscusScript=document.createElement("script");Object.entries(giscusAttributes).forEach(([t,e])=>giscusScript.setAttribute(t,e)),document.getElementById("giscus_thread").appendChild(giscusScript);</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> Â© Copyright 2023 Fan Pu Zeng.
