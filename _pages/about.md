Hello! I am Fan Pu, having recently completed both my M.S and B.S in Computer
Science in Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I am currently enjoying
my summer break before I start work full-time in August.

At CMU, I was actively involved in the open-source programming assignment
auto-grading platform [Autolab](https://autolabproject.com/) from 2018-2023. I
served as the Masters Student Liaison for the [Singapore Students
Association](https://cmussa.org/). I also used to play Capture-The-Flag (CTF)
competitions with [PPP](https://pwning.net/). I previously interned at [Jane
Street](https://www.janestreet.com/), [Meta](https://about.meta.com/),
[Asana](https://asana.com/), and [Saleswhale](https://www.saleswhale.com/)
(acquired 2022).  I was a TA for [10-708 Probabilistic Graphical
Models](https://andrejristeski.github.io/10708-S23/) in the Spring 2023
semester.

I am broadly interested in rigorously proving why machine learning techniques
work and what guarantees we can extract out of them, borrowing tools from
theoretical computer science and mathematics. My eventual goal is to build a
startup in AI/ML using the things that I've learnt, for the betterment of
humanity. 

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, running, learning new things, writing new
things for my blog, and watching anime. I used to do sprint canoe competitively.
If I have an extended break I enjoy traveling, especially hiking and exploring
the great outdoors. Most of the banner pictures on my blog posts were taken
during these hikes.

I grew up in my hometown Singapore before moving to the US for college. I try
to go back and visit once a year.

Feel free to reach out to me at fzeng[at]alumni[dot]cmu[dot]edu. I am happy to
chat and share any of my experiences.
Unfortunately, I am unable to provide referrals for people that I have not
worked with.

I have a Technician amateur radio license, and my callsign is 
[KC3UFE](https://www.fccbulletin.com/callsign/?q=KC3UFE).

This blog was originally started on 24 June 2018, although it has taken many
forms since then. I write about things that I find interesting, and which might
be helpful for other people, with the goal that people learn something
new when they read them. I try to have my posts reviewed by
friends who are knowledgeable in an area whenever possible to ensure that
what is presented is factually accurate. Do let me know if you have any article
suggestions. All banner pictures on the blog are taken by yours truly!
