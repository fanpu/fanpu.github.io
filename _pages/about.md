Hello! I am Fan Pu, currently a M.S in Computer Science student at Carnegie
Mellon University (CMU), having recently completed my Bachelor's in Computer
Science in 2022 at CMU as well. I have been involved in the open-source
programming assignment auto-grading platform
[Autolab](https://autolabproject.com/) since 2018.  I currently serve as the
Masters Student Liaison for the [Singapore Students
Association](https://cmussa.org/). I also used to play
Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions with [PPP](https://pwning.net/).

I am broadly interested in rigorously proving why machine learning techniques
work and what guarantees we can extract out of them, borrowing tools from
theoretical computer science and mathematics.
My eventual goal is to build a startup
in AI/ML using the things that I've learnt.
My other academic interests include
complexity theory, programming language theory, and mathematics.

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, running, reading textbooks, watching
anime, playing Genshin Impact, and cosplaying at anime conventions. If I have
an extended break I enjoy traveling, especially hiking and exploring the great
outdoors.

I grew up in my hometown Singapore before moving to the US for college. I try
to go back and visit once a year.

Feel free to reach out to me at fzeng[dot]andrew[dot]cmu[dot]edu.
Unfortunately, I am unable to provide referrals for people that I have not
worked with.

I recently earned a Technician amateur radio license, and my callsign is 
[KC3UFE](https://www.fccbulletin.com/callsign/?q=KC3UFE).

This blog was originally started on 24 June 2018, although
it has taken many forms since then.
