Hello! I am Fan Pu, currently a M.S in Computer Science student at Carnegie
Mellon University (CMU), having recently completed my Bachelor's in Computer
Science in 2022 at CMU as well. I have been actively involved in the open-source
programming assignment auto-grading platform
[Autolab](https://autolabproject.com/) since 2018. 
I currently serve as the Masters Student Liaison for the [Singapore Students
Association](https://cmussa.org/). I also used to play
Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions with [PPP](https://pwning.net/).
I have previously interned at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/),
[Meta](https://about.meta.com/), [Asana](https://asana.com/), and [Saleswhale](https://www.saleswhale.com/) (acquired 2022).
This semester (Spring 2023), I will be a TA for 10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models.

I am broadly interested in rigorously proving why machine learning techniques
work and what guarantees we can extract out of them, borrowing tools from
theoretical computer science and mathematics. My eventual goal is to build a
startup in AI/ML using the things that I've learnt, for the betterment of
humanity. 

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, running, learning new things, watching
anime, playing Genshin Impact, and cosplaying. If I have an extended break I
enjoy traveling, especially hiking and exploring the great outdoors. Most of
the banner pictures on my blog posts were taken during these hikes.

I grew up in my hometown Singapore before moving to the US for college. I try
to go back and visit once a year.

Feel free to reach out to me at fzeng[dot]andrew[dot]cmu[dot]edu.
Unfortunately, I am unable to provide referrals for people that I have not
worked with.

I recently earned a Technician amateur radio license, and my callsign is 
[KC3UFE](https://www.fccbulletin.com/callsign/?q=KC3UFE).

This blog was originally started on 24 June 2018, although it has taken many
forms since then. I write about things that I find interesting, and which might
be helpful for other people, with the goal that people learn something
new when they read my posts. I also try to have my posts reviewed by
my friends who are experts in an area whenever possible to ensure that
everything is factually accurate. Do let me know if you have any article
suggestions. All banner pictures on the blog are taken by yours truly!
