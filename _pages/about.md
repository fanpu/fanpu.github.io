Hello! I am Fan Pu (曾繁朴), and I work on LLM research at Jane Street.
I previously worked on training foundation models to be good at writing OCaml 
and perform valuable trading tasks.

_(2025-09-21) We are hiring_ - if this work sounds interesting to you and
you have strong engineering skills, a solid machine learning
background, and keen interest in pushing the state of the art of LLMs, please
shoot me an email! It's currently an incredibly exciting time to be doing ML here.

I graduated with a B.S (2022) and M.S (2023) in Computer
Science from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

At CMU, I was actively involved in the open-source programming assignment
auto-grading platform [Autolab](https://autolabproject.com/) from 2018-2023. I
served as the Masters Student Liaison for the [Singapore Students
Association](https://cmussa.org/). I also used to play Capture-The-Flag (CTF)
competitions with [PPP](https://pwning.net/). I previously interned at [Jane
Street](https://www.janestreet.com/), [Meta](https://about.meta.com/),
[Asana](https://asana.com/), and [Saleswhale](https://www.saleswhale.com/)
(acquired 2022). I was a TA for [10-708 Probabilistic Graphical
Models](https://andrejristeski.github.io/10708-S23/) in the Spring 2023
semester.

My academic interests lie in understanding the theoretical foundations for the
success of deep learning, particularly in optimization and generalization.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, running, skiing, reading and
learning new things, and writing things for my blog. I used to
do sprint canoe competitively. If I have an extended break I enjoy traveling,
especially hiking and exploring the great outdoors. Most of the banner pictures
on my blog posts were taken during these hikes. My favorite classroom in CMU is
GHC 4303.

I grew up in my hometown Singapore before moving to the US for college and work.
I try to go back and visit once a year.

Feel free to reach out to me at fzeng[at]alumni[dot]cmu[dot]edu. I am happy to
chat and provide advice.

Regrettably, I am unable to provide referrals for people that I have not
directly collaborated with, as I cannot write you a meaningful recommendation.

I have a Technician amateur radio license, with callsign
[KC3UFE](https://www.fccbulletin.com/callsign/?q=KC3UFE).

This blog was originally started on 24 June 2018, although it has taken many
forms since then. All banner pictures on the blog are taken by yours truly!
