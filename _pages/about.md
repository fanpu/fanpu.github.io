Hello! I am Fan Pu, and I help large language models have a good time at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) on the AI Assistants team.

Specifically, I work on fine-tuning LLMs to be proficient at writing OCaml,
crafting evals for a variety of (mostly coding-related) tasks that we care
about, and leading the development of several in-house RAG use cases, including
for trading. 

*Our team is hiring* - if this sounds interesting to you and you believe you are
*a
good fit, please shoot me an email!

I recently graduated with a M.S (2023) and B.S (2022) in Computer
Science from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

At CMU, I was actively involved in the open-source programming assignment
auto-grading platform [Autolab](https://autolabproject.com/) from 2018-2023. I
served as the Masters Student Liaison for the [Singapore Students
Association](https://cmussa.org/). I also used to play Capture-The-Flag (CTF)
competitions with [PPP](https://pwning.net/). I previously interned at [Jane
Street](https://www.janestreet.com/), [Meta](https://about.meta.com/),
[Asana](https://asana.com/), and [Saleswhale](https://www.saleswhale.com/)
(acquired 2022). I was a TA for [10-708 Probabilistic Graphical
Models](https://andrejristeski.github.io/10708-S23/) in the Spring 2023
semester.

My current academic interests lies in understanding reasoning in large language
models and exploring the theoretical foundations of deep learning. Specifically,
I am interested in the principles underlying generalization and the mechanisms
contributing to the effectiveness of optimization algorithms.

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, K-pop dance, running, reading and
learning new things, writing things for my blog, and watching anime. I used to
do sprint canoe competitively. If I have an extended break I enjoy traveling,
especially hiking and exploring the great outdoors. Most of the banner pictures
on my blog posts were taken during these hikes. My favorite classroom in CMU is
GHC 4303.

I grew up in my hometown Singapore before moving to the US for college and work.
I try to go back and visit once a year.

Feel free to reach out to me at fzeng[at]alumni[dot]cmu[dot]edu. I am happy to
chat and provide advice.

Regrettably, I am unable to provide referrals for people that I have not
directly collaborated with, as I cannot write you a meaningful recommendation.

I have a Technician amateur radio license, with callsign 
[KC3UFE](https://www.fccbulletin.com/callsign/?q=KC3UFE).

This blog was originally started on 24 June 2018, although it has taken many
forms since then. All banner pictures on the blog are taken by yours truly!
