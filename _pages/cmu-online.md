There are many great course offerings from the top-ranked Computer Science
program in Carnegie Mellon University whose lectures are available on the public
domain. The purpose of this page is to curate these courses, so people can learn
from the best professors in the world without the hefty college price tag.

Courses which are accessible to undergraduates will have a
<span class="badge rounded-pill undergraduate"> </span> tag.
This does not mean that the difficulty is not suitable for graduate students;
on the contrary, almost all such classes are cross-listed as graduate courses
and are commonly taken by graduate students at CMU. There are also some
graduate classes (based on the course number) which are suitable for advanced
undergraduates which I marked as undergraduate as well.
Classes that require significant background and which are less accessible will
have a <span class="badge rounded-pill graduate"> </span> tag.

Some courses are only publicly available on Panopto instead of Youtube, in which
case I provided a link to the Panopto playlist. It can be more conducive to use
Panopto than Youtube in some cases due to the ability to customize speaker and
presentation view.

Within each category, the courses are not ordered in any particular
way that is indicative of difficulty or the order in which they
should be considered. Consider them to be arbitrary.

Please let me know if there are any dead links, or if you spot an error with the page.
