When do we have algorithmic results?
- optimizing a single layer (random features)
- local results (Polyak condition)


Functions of some form induces a RKHS...

if very wide:
sums become integrals
those kind of function can be approximated by a two-layer
network


something something only requires a finite number of basis elements?? such that it is close?

construction: sample uniformly from omega

Show: function classes learnable via SGD
